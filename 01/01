We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R)\nprograms whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the\ncontinuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action\nis based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter\nbinding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other\ncircuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it\nis constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the\ncontingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R\nprograms are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is\ncompatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe\nsome experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and\nactual mobile robots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 1994 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
