The interpolation into the\nzoa is based on the assumed gravitational nature of the velocity field implying\na potential flow. The main dynamical features at a distance r=4000 km/s are (a)\nthe peak of the Great Attractor connecting Centaurus and Pavo at l=330, (b) a\nmoderate bridge connecting Perseus-Pisces and Cepheus at l= 140, and (c) an\nextension of a large void from the southern Galactic hemisphere into the zoa\nnear the direction of Puppis, l=220-270. We find a strong correlation between\nthe mass density and the IRAS and optical galaxy density at $b=+-20, which\nindicates that the main dynamical features in the zoa should also be seen in\ngalaxy surveys through the Galactic plane. The gravitational acceleration at\nthe Local Group, based on the mass distribution out to 6000 km/s, is strongly\naffected by the mass distribution in the zoa: its direction changes by 31 when\nthe |b| < 20 zoa is included, bringing it to within 4 +- 19 of the CMB dipole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 1994 12:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
