We derive a modified\nset of transport equations that satisfy causality. These equations are obtained\nfrom the underlying Boltzmann equation. We use a simple model for particle\ncollisions which enables us to derive moment equations non-perturbatively, i.e.\nwithout making the usual assumption that the distribution function deviates\nonly slightly from its equilibrium value. We apply the model to two problems:\nparticle diffusion and viscous transport. In both cases we show that signals\npropagate at a finite speed and therefore that the formalism obeys causality.\nWhen the velocity gradient is large on the scale of a mean free path, the\nviscous shear stress is suppressed relative to the prediction of the standard\ndiffusion approximation. The shear stress reaches a maximum at a finite value\nof the shear amplitude and then decreases as the velocity gradient increases.\nIn the case of a steady Keplerian accretion disk with hydrodynamic turbulent\nviscosity, the stress-limit translates to an upper bound on the Shakura-Sunyaev\n$\\alpha$-parameter, namely $\\alpha<0.07$. The limit on $\\alpha$ is much\nstronger in narrow boundary layers where the velocity shear is larger than\nKeplerian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 1994 20:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
