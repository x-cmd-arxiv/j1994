The most\ndeveloped model is the tidal model which fails to reproduce several of its\ncharacteristic properties. We suggest an alternative model for the origin of\nthe Stream which can explain all of its observed features and dynamics, as well\nas provide a strong constraint on the distribution of gas within the halo of\nthe Milky Way. We propose that the Stream consists of material which was\nram-pressure stripped from the Magellanic System during its last passage\nthrough an extended ionized disk of the Galaxy. This collision took place some\n500 million years ago at a galacto-centric distance of about 65 kpc, and swept\n$\\sim 20$\\% of the least bound HI into the Stream. The gas with the lowest\ncolumn density lost the most orbital angular momentum, and is presently at the\ntip of the Stream, having fallen to a distance of $\\sim 20$ kpc from the Milky\nWay attaining a negative velocity of 200 \\kms. To prevent the stripped material\nfrom leading the Magellanic Clouds and attaining too large an infall velocity,\nwe postulate the existence of an extended dilute halo of diffuse ionized gas\nsurrounding the Milky Way. If the halo gas is at the virial temperature of the\npotential well of the Milky Way, its thermal emission would contribute $\\sim$\n40\\% of the observed diffuse background radiation in the 0.5-1.0 keV (M) band,\nconsistent with recent ROSAT measurements as well as pulsar dispersion\nmeasures.

The\ncharacter of the Pr K-edge XAFS data indicate that most of the Pr substitutes\nonto the Y site and is well ordered with respect to the unit cell. These data\nalso show that the amplitude of the first Pr-O peak is greatly reduced when\ncompared to the first Y-O peak in pure YBCO, and decreases with increasing Pr\nconcentration. In contrast, the Y K-edge data for these alloys show little if\nany change in the oxygen environment, while the Cu K-edge data show a 10\\%\nreduction in the first Cu-O peak.
