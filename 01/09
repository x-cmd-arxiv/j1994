Formulas are derived\nshowing how adiabatic change of the Hamiltonian transforms one steady state\ninto another. It is shown that for infinite systems, sudden change of the\nHamiltonian also tends to produce steady states, after a transition period of\noscillations. These naturally arising steady states are compared to the\nmaximum-entropy state (the thermal state) and are seen not to coincide in\ngeneral. The approach to equilibrium of subsystems consisting of n coupled\nharmonic oscillators has been widely studied, but only in the simple case where\nn=1. The power of our results is that they can be applied to more complex\nsubsustems, where n>1. It is shown that the use of coupled harmonic oscillators\nas heat baths models is fraught with some problems that do not appear in the\nsimple n=1 case. Specifically, the thermal states that are though to be\nachievable through hard-sphere collisions with heat-bath particles can\ngenerally NOT be achieved with harmonic coupling to the heat-bath particles,\nexcept approximately when the coupling is weak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 1994 15:15:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 1996 15:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
