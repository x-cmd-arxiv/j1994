Using up-to-date optical constants, the charge on the\ngrains exposed to the diffuse galactic UV flux has been calculated. An\nanalytical approximation for the grain charge has been derived, which is then\nused to obtain the grain rotation frequency. Grains are found to have\nsubstantial radio emission peaked at a cutoff frequency in the range\n10-100~GHz, depending on the grain size distribution and on the efficiency of\nthe radiative damping of the grain rotation. The dust radio emission is\ncompared to the free-free emission from the ionized gas component; some\nconstraints on the magnetic field strength in the observed dusty filaments are\nalso discussed. The model can be used to test the disk-halo interface\nenvironment in spiral galaxies, to determine the amount and size distribution\nof dust in their ionized component, and to investigate the rotation mechanisms\nfor the dust. Numerical estimates are given for experimental purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 1994 15:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
