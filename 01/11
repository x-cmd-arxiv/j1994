Particular attention is paid to Linde's second-order `Hybrid\nInflation'; with the false vacuum dominating, inflation differs from the usual\ntrue vacuum case both in its cosmology and in its relation to particle physics.\nThe spectral index of the adiabatic density perturbation can be very close to\n1, or it can be around ten percent higher. The energy scale at the end of\ninflation can be anywhere between $10^{16}$\\,GeV and $10^{11}$\\,GeV, though\nreheating is prompt so the reheat temperature can't be far below\n$10^{11}\\,$GeV. Topological defects are almost inevitably produced at the end\nof inflation, and if the inflationary energy scale is near its upper limit they\ncan have significant effects.\n  Because false vacuum inflation occurs with the inflaton field far below the\nPlanck scale, it is easier to implement in the context of supergravity than\nstandard chaotic inflation. That the inflaton mass is small compared with the\ninflationary Hubble parameter is still a problem for generic supergravity\ntheories, but remarkably this can be avoided in a natural way for a class of\nsupergravity models which follow from orbifold compactification of\nsuperstrings.

This corresponds to\nidentifying the manifold consisting of the union of the low energy critical\npoints of the potential along with the gradient flow curves joining these\ntogether and by positing that the dynamics is restricted here. The kinetic\nenergy provides an induced metric on this manifold while restricting the full\npotential energy to the manifold defines a potential. The low energy dynamics\nis now constrained to these finite number of degrees of freedom. For large\nseparation of the two Skyrmions the manifold is parametrised by the variables\nof the product ansatz. We find the interaction between two Skyrmions coming\nfrom the induced metric, which was independently found by Schroers. We find\nthat the static potential is actually negligible in comparison to this\ninteraction. Thus to lowest order, at large separation, the dynamics reduces to\ngeodesic motion on the manifold. We consider the scattering to first order in\nthe interaction using the perturbative method of Lagrange and find that the\ndynamics in the no spin or charge exchange sector reduces to the Kepler\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 1994 03:55:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 1994 16:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

In this PWA the energy range for both pp\nand np is now 0 < Tlab < 350 MeV and a chi^2_{d.o.f.}=1.08 was reached. The\nimplications for the pion-nucleon coupling constants are discussed. Comments\nare made with respect to recent discussions around this coupling constant in\nthe literature. In the second part, we briefly sketch the picture of the baryon\nin several, more or less QCD-based, quark-models that have been rather\nprominent in the literature. Inspired by these pictures we constructed a new\nsoft-core model for the nucleon-nucleon interaction and present the first\nresults of this model in a chi^2 -fit to the new multi-energy Nijmegen PWA.\nWith this new model we succeeded in narrowing the gap between theory and\nexperiment at low energies. For the energies Tlab = 25-320 MeV we reached a\nrecord low chi^2_{p.d.p.} = 1.16. We finish the paper with some conclusions and\nan outlook describing the extension of the new model to baryon-baryon\nscattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 1994 16:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
