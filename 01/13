The latter are due to a\ncombination of overionisation and optical pumping in resonance lines, both\ncaused by the hot, non-local, ultraviolet radiation fields in the line-forming\nregions. They lead to an underestimation of the boron abundance when analysis\nmethods assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are used. The abundance\ncorrection, for the 249.7~nm resonance line, amounts to $+$0.6 dex for the\nmetal-poor star HD140283 and $+$0.4 dex for Procyon. No significant NLTE\neffects are predicted for the Sun. Applying the abundance correction on the\nresults for HD140283 of Duncan et al. (1992) leads to a B/Be ratio well above\nthe minimum value required by spallation production of beryllium. The\nreliability of the results in view of atomic and atmospheric uncertainties is\ndiscussed. With the possible exception of photospheric inhomogeneity, it seems\nunlikely that these could remove the effect for HD140283.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 1994 17:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Adopting the baryon\nscalar and vector selfenergies from the empirical optical potential for\nproton-nucleus elastic scattering and from Dirac-Brueckner calculations at\nhigher density rho > rho_0 we examine the differential pbar spectra as a\nfunction of the antiproton selfenergy. A detailed comparison with the available\nexperimental data for p-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus reactions shows that the\nantiproton feels a moderately attractive mean-field at normal nuclear matter\ndensity rho_0 which is in line with a dispersive potential extracted from the\nfree annihilation cross section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 1994 13:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

In the second part we demonstrate some algorithms which may\nbe used to analyse, and often to solve, the resulting systems of overdetermined\nnonlinear PDEs. We take as our principal example a generalised Boussinesq\nequation, which arises in shallow water theory. Although the equation appears\nto be non-integrable, we obtain an exact ``two-soliton'' solution from a\nnonclassical reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 1994 17:32:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 1994 16:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
