These families arise as nonclassical symmetry reduction solutions and\nsolutions found using the singular manifold method. This example shows that\nnonclassical symmetries and the singular manifold method do not, in general,\nyield the same solution set. We also obtain symmetry reductions of the shallow\nwater equation solvable in terms of solutions of the first, third and fifth\nPainleve equations. We give evidence that the variety of solutions found which\nexhibit ``nonlinear superposition'' is not an artefact of the equation being\nlinearisable since the equation is solvable by inverse scattering.
