An\nomega_1 --tree is called a Kurepa tree if all its levels are countable and it\nhas more than omega_1 branches. An omega_1 --tree is called a Jech--Kunen tree\nif it has kappa branches for some kappa strictly between omega_1 and\n2^{omega_1}. A Kurepa tree is called an essential Kurepa tree if it contains no\nJech--Kunen subtrees. A Jech--Kunen tree is called an essential Jech--Kunen\ntree if it contains no Kurepa subtrees. In this paper we prove that (1) it is\nconsistent with CH and 2^{omega_1}> omega_2 that there exist essential Kurepa\ntrees and there are no essential Jech--Kunen trees, (2) it is consistent with\nCH and 2^{omega_1}> omega_2 plus the existence of a Kurepa tree with\n2^{omega_1} branches that there exist essential Jech--Kunen trees and there are\nno essential Kurepa trees. In the second result we require the existence of a\nKurepa tree with 2^{omega_1} branches in order to avoid triviality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 1994 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

Cichon, Morayne,\nPawlikowski and Solecki proved that cov(Meager) <= dec <= d and asked whether\nthese inequalities could, consistently, be strict. By cov(Meager) is meant the\nleast number of closed nowhere dense sets required to cover the real line and\nby d is denoted the least cardinal of a dominating family in omega^omega.\nSteprans showed that it is consistent that cov(Meager) not= dec. In this paper\nwe show that the second inequality can also be made strict. The model where dec\nis different from d is the one obtained by adding omega_2 Miller - sometimes\nknown as super-perfect or rational-perfect - reals to a model of the Continuum\nHypothesis. It is somewhat surprising that the model used to establish the\nconsistency of the other inequality, cov(Meager) not= dec, is a slight\nmodification of the iteration of super-perfect forcing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 1994 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

Unlike the nonrelativistic\nformulation, the relativistic Coulomb sum is restricted to spacelike\nfour-momenta for the most direct connection with experiments; an immediate\nconsequence is that excitations involving antinucleons, e.g., $N{\\bar N}$ pair\nproduction, are approximately eliminated from the sum rule. Relativistic recoil\nand Fermi motion of target nucleons are correctly incorporated. The sum rule\ndecomposes into one- and two-body parts, with correlation information in the\nsecond. The one-body part requires information on the nucleon momentum\ndistribution function, which is incorporated by a moment expansion method. The\nsum rule given through the second moment (RCSR-II) is tested in the Fermi gas\nmodel, and is shown to be sufficiently accurate for applications to data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 1994 18:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
