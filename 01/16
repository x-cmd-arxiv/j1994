If the\nhopping between the conduction band and the localized heavy orbitals depends on\nthe occupation of the atomic orbitals in the conduction band then orbital Kondo\ncorrelation occurs. The noncommutative nature of the coupling required for the\nKondo effect is formally due to the form factors associated with the assisted\nhopping which in the momentum representation depends on the momenta of the\nconduction electrons involved. The leading logarithmic vertex corrections are\ndue to the local Coulomb interaction between the electrons on the heavy orbital\nand in the conduction band. The renormalized vertex functions are obtained as a\nsolution of a closed set of differential equations and they show power\nbehavior. The amplitude of large renormalization is determined by an infrared\ncutoff due to finite energy and dispersion of the heavy particles. The enhanced\nassisted hopping rate results in mass enhancement and attractive interaction in\nthe conduction band. The superconductivity transition temperature calculated is\nlargest for intermediate mass enhancement, $m^*/m \\approx 2-3$. For larger mass\nenhancement the small one particle weight ($Z$) in the Green's function reduces\nthe transition temperature which may be characteristic for other\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 1994 18:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The problem is addressed from the\npoint of view of both canonical quantum gravity and superstring theory. The\nentropy per unit area of a free scalar field propagating in a fixed black hole\nbackground is shown to be quadratically divergent near the horizon. It is shown\nthat such quantum corrections to the entropy per unit area are equivalent to\nthe quantum corrections to the gravitational coupling. Unlike field theory,\nsuperstring theory provides a set of identifiable configurations which give\nrise to the classical contribution to the entropy per unit area. These\nconfigurations can be understood as open superstrings with both ends attached\nto the horizon. The entropy per unit area is shown to be finite to all orders\nin superstring perturbation theory. The importance of these conclusions to the\nresolution of the problem of black hole information loss is reiterated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 1994 21:16:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 1994 00:41:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 1994 23:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-07"}
