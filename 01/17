These non-linear and coupled equations\nof motion describe the dynamical evolution of correlation green's functions of\ndifferent order and transparently show how many-body correlations are generated\nby the different interaction terms in a genuine nonperturbative framework. The\nnonperturbative results of the conventional green's function theory are\nincluded in the present formalism as two limiting cases (the so-called ladder\ndiagram summation and ring diagram summation) as well as the familiar\ncorrelation dynamics of density-matrices in the equal time limit. We present\nexplicit expressions for three- and four-body correlation functions that can be\nused to dynamically restore the trace relations for spin-symmetric fermi\nsystems and study numerically the relative importance of two-, three- and\nfour-body correlations for nuclear configurations close to the groundstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 1994 09:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
