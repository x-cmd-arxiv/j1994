We show\nthat these two classes of solutions coincide. The hyperelliptic surfaces\ncorresponding to the second class appear to be double unramified coverings of\nthe Riemann surfaces corresponding to the first class of solutions. We also\ndiscuss the soliton limits of these solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 1994 14:42:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 1994 14:56:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 1994 14:31:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 1994 19:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
