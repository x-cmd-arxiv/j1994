We have improved upon previous efforts to model the spectra from\nthese pulsars (e. g. Cheng, et al. 1986b; Ho 1989) by following the variation\nin particle production and radiation properties with position in the outer gap.\nCurvature, synchrotron and inverse-Compton scattering fluxes vary significantly\nover the gap and their interactions {\\it via} photon-photon pair production\nbuild up the radiating charge populations at varying rates. We have also\nincorporated an approximate treatment of the transport of particle and photon\nfluxes between gap emission zones. These effects, along with improved\ncomputations of the particle and photon distributions, provide very important\nmodifications of the model gamma-ray flux. In particular, we attempt to make\nspecific predictions of pulse profile shapes and spectral variations as a\nfunction of pulse phase and suggest further extensions to the model which may\nprovide accurate computations of the observed high energy emissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 1994 21:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
