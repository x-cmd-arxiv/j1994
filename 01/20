It is shown that using the\nPolyakov sum over bordered surfaces in the Feynman path integral quantization\nscheme one gets a consistent quantum mechanics of relativistic 1-dim extended\nobjects in the range $1<d<25$. In particular the BDHP string propagator is\nexactly calculated for arbitrary initial and final string configurations and\nthe Hilbert space of physical states of noncritical BDHP string is explicitly\nconstructed. The resulting theory is equivalent to the Fairlie-Chodos-Thorn\nmassive string model. In contrast to the conventional conformal field theory\napproach to noncritical string and random surfaces in the Euclidean target\nspace the path integral formulation of the Fairlie-Chodos-Thorn string obtained\nin this paper does not rely on the principle of conformal invariance. Some\nconsequences of this feature for constructing a consistent relativistic string\ntheory based on the \"splitting-joining\" interaction are discussed.}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 1994 13:18:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 1994 12:39:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 1994 14:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
