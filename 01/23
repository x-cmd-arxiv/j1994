A subtle interplay between the\naxial anomaly and the current-quark masses is shown to play important roles,\nand a realistic evaluation of the strangeness and heavy quark contents of\nhadrons is given. In Part II, the NJL model is applied to the system at finite\ntemperature ($T$) and density\n  ($\\rho$) relevant to the early universe, interior of the neutron stars and\nthe ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions.
