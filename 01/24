We find that if the torus is\nCompton thick, it can scatter at small angles a significant fraction of the\nnuclear radiation, and contribute to the continuum of Seyfert 1 galaxies above\n$\\sim$10 keV, and to the fluorescence iron line at 6.4 keV. At large\ninclination angles and for large torus column densities, the spectrum is\nattenuated by photoabsorption and Compton scattering, while the iron\nfluorescence line produced by the torus can have large equivalent widths. Even\nafter dilution by the continuum scattered by the warm material outside the\ntorus, this iron line could be strong enough to explain the ``cold\" component\nin the spectrum of NGC 1068. We stress that the complex pattern of the\npredicted variability can be a powerful tool for constraining the parameters of\nthe model, such as the column density of the torus, its inclination and the\namount of warm scattering material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 1994 08:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
