This drastically improves theoretical properties of the vacuum:\ninstanton size density $d(\\rho)$ stabilizes at $\\rho\\sim 0.2 fm$, all chiral\neffects are formulated in a gauge-invariant way and quarks are confined. An\ninteresting interplay of chiral and confining dynamics is observed; for the\nrealistic values of parameters the Georgi-Manohar picture emerges with chiral\nradius $R_{ch}\\sim \\rho\\sim 0.2 fm$ much less than confining radius $R_c\\sim$\nhadron radius $\\sim 1 fm$. In the limit $R_{ch}\\ll R_c$ the chiral mass\n$M_{ch}(p)$ is unaffected by confinement and can be taken in the local limit\n$M_{ch}(p=0)$. Different types of effective chiral Lagrangians (ECL) are\nobtained, containing all or a part of gluon, quark and Nambu--Goldstone--meson\nfields. The ECL are manifestly gauge--invariant and in the limit of no gluon\nfields coincide with those found previously.\n  The problem of the double role of the pion -- as a Goldstone meson or as a\n$q\\bar{q}$ system is briefly disscussed using confining ECL with quarks, mesons\nand gluons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 1994 09:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}

We find a discrete set\nof domain structures which differ in the quantized lengths of the domains. They\nare stable even without phase conservation, as, for instance, in the presence\nof a subcritical ramp in the control parameter.
