This\nallows one to approach the solution with the same techniques which solve\nQuantum Electrodynamics: namely, a combination of weak-coupling diagrams and\nmany-body quantum mechanics. The key to eliminating necessarily nonperturbative\neffects is the use of a bare Hamiltonian in which quarks and gluons have\nnonzero constituent masses rather than the zero masses of the current picture.\nThe use of constituent masses cuts off the growth of the running coupling\nconstant and makes it possible that the running coupling never leaves the\nperturbative domain. For stabilization purposes an artificial potential is\nadded to the Hamiltonian, but with a coefficient that vanishes at the physical\nvalue of the coupling constant. The weak-coupling approach potentially\nreconciles the simplicity of the Constituent Quark Model with the complexities\nof Quantum Chromodynamics. The penalty for achieving this perturbative picture\nis the necessity of formulating the dynamics of QCD in light-front coordinates\nand of dealing with the complexities of renormalization which such a\nformulation entails. We describe the renormalization process first using a\nqualitative phase space cell analysis, and we then set up a precise similarity\nrenormalization scheme with cutoffs on constituent momenta and exhibit\ncalculations to second order.
