It characterizes the approach to the phase transition in\nall systems that belong to the 3d Ising universality class. We compute it from\nthe probability distributions of the average magnetization in the 3d Ising\nmodel in a homogeneous external field, obtained by Monte Carlo. We find that\nthe $\\varphi^6$ term in $V_{eff}$ is important, while the higher terms can be\nneglected within our statistical errors. Thus we obtain the approximate\neffective action $$ S_{eff} = \\int d^3 x \\left\\{\n  {1 \\over 2} \\partial_\\mu \\varphi \\partial_\\mu \\varphi +\n  {1 \\over 2} m^2 \\varphi^2 + m g_4 \\varphi^4 + g_6 \\varphi^6 \\right\\} , $$\nwith arbitrary mass $m$ that sets the scale, and dimensionless couplings $g_4 =\n0.97 \\pm 0.02$ and $g_6 = 2.05 \\pm 0.15$. The value of $g_4$ is consistent with\nthe renormalization group fixed point coupling. This $V_{eff}$, when used\ninstead of the traditional $a \\varphi^2 + b \\varphi^4$, turns the\nGinzburg--Landau description of the long-wave properties of the 3d theory near\ncriticality into quantitatively accurate. It is also relevant to the theory of\ncosmological phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 1994 19:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
