This gives the generalization of our results about Fano 3-folds\nwith Q-factorial terminal singularities (Preprint alg-geom/9311007).\n  As an application, we get the following result about 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds X: Assume that the Picard number \\rho (X) > 93. Then one of two cases\n(i) or (ii) holds:\n  (i) there exists a small extremal ray on X;\n  (ii) There exists a nef element h such that h^3=0 (thus, the nef cone NEF(X)\nand the cubic intersection hypersurface W_X have a common point; here, we don't\nclaim that h is rational!).\n  As a corollary, we get: Let X be a 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold. Assume\nthat the nef cone NEF(X) is finite polyhedral and X does not have a small\nextremal ray. Then there exists a rational nef element h with h^3=0 if\n\\rho(X)>93.\n  To prove these results about Calabi-Yau manifolds, we also use one result of\nV.V.
