It vanishes only when the central charge is integer. We\ngive an algebraic construction of null states and propose the character\nformulae. The character of the Verma module is related to free fields in three\ndimensions which has rather exotic modular properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 1994 12:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

These include symmetry of the 1) low energy effective action, 2) allowed\nspectrum of electric and magnetic charges in the theory, 3) allowed mass\nspectrum of particles saturating the Bogomol'nyi bound, and 4) Yukawa couplings\nbetween massless neutral particles and massive charged particles saturating the\nBogomol'nyi bound. This duality transformation exchanges the electrically\ncharged elementary string excitations with the magnetically charged soliton\nstates in the theory. It is shown that the existence of a strong-weak coupling\nduality symmetry in four dimensional string theory makes definite prediction\nabout the existence of new stable monopole and dyon states in the theory with\nspecific degeneracies, including certain supersymmetric bound states of\nmonopoles and dyons. The relationship between strong-weak coupling duality\ntransformation in string theory and target space duality transformation in the\nfive-brane theory is also discussed.
