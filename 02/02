The abundances of free electrons, metals, complex molecules, and dust\ngrains are constrained to be very small suggesting that the clouds are formed\nfrom a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium. Cosmic rays and background UV\nradiation ionize a halo around the cloud. Radio waves from distant sources will\nbe scattered by the electrons in this halo, an effect which may have already\nbeen observed in quasars such as 1502+106.

We find that the Weyl\nrescaling of supergravity gives rise to Wess-Zumino terms that affect the gauge\ncouplings at the one-loop level. These Wess-Zumino terms are crucial in\nassuring supersymmetric consistency of both perturbative and non-perturbative\ngauge interactions. At the perturbative level, we distinguish between the\nholomorphic Wilsonian gauge couplings and the physically-measurable\nmomentum-dependent effective gauge couplings; the latter are affected by the\nKonishi and the super-Weyl anomalies and their field-dependence is\nnon-holomorphic. At the non-perturbative level, we show how consistency of the\nscalar potential generated by infrared-strong gauge interactions with the local\nsupersymmetry requires a very specific form of the effective superpotential. We\nuse this superpotential to determine the dependence of the supersymmetric\ncondensates of a strongly interacting gauge theory on its (field-dependent)\nWilsonian gauge coupling and the Yukawa couplings of the matter fields. The\narticle concludes with the discussion of the field-dependent non-perturbative\nphenomena in the context of string unification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 1994 23:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 1994 19:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
