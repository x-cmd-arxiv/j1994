This\ndescription of heavy deformed nuclei is based on pseudo spin symmetry, and is\nable to correctly predict the collective spectra and their transition\namplitudes, using appropriate effective charges. It also gives a very good\ndescription of the exotic double beta decay, a hard test of any nuclear model.\nThe simplest pseudo SU(3) assumptions describe nucleons in the abnormal parity\nstates as having seniority zero. This idea is very useful as a mathematical\nsimplification, and is also able to give a nice description of the backbending\nphenomena, but has been challenged in a recent study about effective charges\nand $BE2(0^+_1 \\rightarrow 2^+_1)$ systematics. We carefully checked this\nstatement and conclude that the seniority zero approach is a formal way of\nassign abnormal parity nucleons a passive role. The contribution of the\nabnormal parity nucleons to the nuclear quadrupole moments is finite but only a\nfraction of their asymptotic Nilsson values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 1994 17:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A transition from stationary, axisymmetric flames to stationary\ncellular flames is predicted analytically if $Le$ is decreased below a critical\nvalue. We present the results of numerical computations to show that as $Le$ is\nfurther decreased traveling waves (TWs) along the flame front arise via an\ninfinite-period bifurcation which breaks the reflection symmetry of the\ncellular array. Upon further decreasing $Le$ different kinds of periodically\nmodulated traveling waves (MTWs) as well as a branch of quasiperiodically\nmodulated traveling waves (QPMTWs) arise. These transitions are accompanied by\nthe development of different spatial and temporal symmetries including period\ndoublings and period halvings. We also observe the apparently chaotic temporal\nbehavior of a disordered cellular pattern involving creation and annihilation\nof cells. We analytically describe the stability of the TW solution near its\nonset+ using suitable phase-amplitude equations. Within this framework one of\nthe MTW's can be identified as a localized wave traveling through an underlying\nstationary, spatially periodic structure. We study the Eckhaus instability of\nthe TW and find that in general they are unstable at onset in infinite systems.\nThey can, however, become stable for larger amplitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 1994 19:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
