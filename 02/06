The similarity is based on a similar behaviour of the\nhigh-gradient operators determining the high-order cumulants. The one-loop\nrenormalization-group corrections make the anomalous dimension of the operator\nthat governs the $s$-th cumulant proportional to $s(s-1)$ thus overtaking for\nlarge $s$ the negative normal dimension. As behaviour of the ensemble-averaged\ndiffusion coefficient is quite different in these models, it suggests that a\npossible universality in the distribution functions is independent of the\nbehaviour of average quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 1994 18:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
