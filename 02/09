Employees decide whether or not to contribute to production based\non their expectations as to how other employees will act. Trained workers learn\nover time and fold their increased productivity into their decision whether or\nnot to contribute. We find that the dynamical behavior at the two levels is\nclosely coupled: the evolution of the industry over time depends not only on\nthe characteristics of training programs, learning curves, and cost-benefit\nanalyses, but on the vagaries of chance as well. For example, in one case, the\ndouble dilemma can be resolved for the industry as a whole and productivity\nthen increases steadily over time. In another, the organizational level dilemma\nmay remain unresolved and workers may contribute at fluctuating levels. In this\ncase the overall productivity stays low. We also find a correlation between\nhigh productivity and low turnover and show that a small increase in training\nrates can lead to explosive growth in productivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 1994 22:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
