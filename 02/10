The quotient depends on a choice of an ample\nlinearized line bundle. Two choices are equivalent if they give rise to\nidentical quotients. A priori, there are infinitely many choices since there\nare infinitely many isomorphism classes of linearized ample line bundles. Hence\nseveral fundamental questions naturally arise. Is the set of equivalence\nclasses, and hence the set of non-isomorphic quotients, finite? How does the\nquotient vary under change of the equivalence class? In this paper we give\npartial answers to these questions in the case of actions of reductive\nalgebraic groups on nonsingular projective algebraic varieties. We shall show\nthat among ample line bundles which give projective geometric quotients there\nare only finitely many equivalence classes. These classes span certain convex\nsubsets (chambers) in a certain convex cone in Euclidean space; and when we\ncross a wall separating one chamber from another, the corresponding quotient\nundergoes a birational transformation which is similar to a Mori flip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 1994 19:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 1994 20:49:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 1994 16:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 1995 02:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

A population\nof bound systems with mass of $\\sim 10^5-10^6\\solarmass$ is also an attractive\npossibility since it is close to the baryon Jeans mass at recombination, which\nmay be the preferred mass scale for the first bound objects to form in the\nuniverse.

Such theories\npredict a new kind of force, which could provide answers to several open\nquestions in cosmology. The possible role of such a ``primeval'' force will be\ndiscussed in the framework of the Big Bang Theory. Although such a force cannot\nbe observed directly, there are several predictions of GUT's, which can be\nverified at low energies. The MSSM distinguishes itself from other GUT's by a\nsuccessful prediction of many unrelated phenomena with a minimum number of\nparameters. Among them: a) Unification of the couplings constants; b)\nUnification of the masses; c) Existence of dark matter; d) Proton decay; e)\nelectroweak symmetry breaking at a scale far below the unification scale. A\ncombined fit shows that indeed the MSSM model can satisfy all these constraints\nsimultaneously. The corresponding constraints on the as yet unknown top mass,\nthe strong coupling constant, and all SUSY masses are given within the minimal\nmodel, taking into account the complete second order RGE's for the couplings\nand the one-loop corrected Higgs potential for the calculation of the Z and the\nHiggs masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 1994 11:08:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 1994 12:24:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 1994 09:58:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 26 May 1994 12:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2001 09:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-22"}
