Based on a previous\nphenomenological analysis we use the global hydrodynamics model to show that\nthe amount of initial flow, or initial energy density, cannot be determined\nfrom the hadronic momentum spectra. We additionally find that almost always a\nsizeable transverse flow deve- lops, which causes the system to freeze out,\nthereby limiting the flow velocity in itself. This freeze-out dominance in turn\nmakes a distinction between a plasma and a hadron resonance gas equation of\nstate very difficult, whereas a pure pion gas can easily be ruled out from\npresent data. To complete the picture we also analyze particle multiplicity\ndata, which suggest that chemical equilibrium is not reached with respect to\nthe strange particles. However, the over- population of pions seems to be at\nmost moderate, with a pion chemical potential far away from the Bose\ndivergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 1994 20:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The stablity analysis\nreveals the existence of imaginary eigenvalues for a confining potential that\ntransforms as a Lorentz scalar. Moreover, we argue that the instability\npersists even for very large values of the constituent quark mass.
