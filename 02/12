This model entails well\ndetermined low-energy phenomenology, such as the value of the neutralino dark\nmatter relic abundance and a negative contribution to the vacuum energy. A\npositive contribution to the vacuum energy is also typically present in string\ntheory as a consequence of the running of the fundamental constants towards\ntheir fixed point values. If these two contributions cancel appropriately, one\nmay end up with a vacuum energy which brings many cosmological observations\ninto better agreement with theoretical expectations. The present abundance of\nneutralinos would then be fixed.

In the\nframework of dimensional regularization, the partition function is calculated\nto 3 loops for 3 and 4 dimensions, where Polyakov's measure for the functional\nintegration is applied. Although the underlying theory is the non-linear\n$\\sigma $ model, the 3 loop result turns out to be renormalizable in the sense\nthat all the singularities can be absorbed by the couplings occuring so far. In\nfinite volume, this property is highly non trivial and confirms the method for\nthe measure. We also show that the result coincides with the one obtained using\nthe Faddeev- Popov measure. This is also true for the maximal generalization of\nPolyakov's measure: none of the additional invariant terms that can be added\ncontributes to the dimensionally regularized system.
