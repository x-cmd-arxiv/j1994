We show how the angular correlation function of the\nCMBR can be expressed explicitly in terms of the mass autocorrelation function\n$\\xi (r)$ in the Universe. We derive analytic expressions for the angular\ncorrelation function and its multipole moments in terms of integrals over $\\xi\n(r)$ or its second moment, $J_3 (r)$, which does not need to satisfy the sort\nof integral constraint that $\\xi (r)$ must. We derive similar expressions for\nbulk flow velocity in terms of $\\xi$ and $J_3$. One interesting result that\nemerges directly from this analysis is that, for angles $\\theta$, there is a\nsubstantial contribution to the correlation function from a wide range of\ndistance $r$ and that the radial shape of this contribution does not vary\ngreatly with angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 1994 19:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

In the other set of simulations we study the\napproach to criticality in the disordered phase, making use of improved\nestimators for measurements. From both sets of simulations we obtain clear\nevidence that the critical exponents agree with the exactly known exponents for\nregular lattices, i.e., that (lattice) universality holds for the\ntwo-dimensional Ising model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 1994 12:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
