We also discuss the complications that arise for non-regular\nmaps and in the presence of non-trivial $G$-bundles. In particular, we\nestablish a relation between the existence of regular sections of a non-trivial\nadjoint bundle and restrictions of the structure group of a principal\n$G$-bundle to $T$. We use these results to justify a Weyl integral formula for\nfunctional integrals which, as a novel feature not seen in the\nfinite-dimensional case, contains a summation over all those topological\n$T$-sectors which arise as restrictions of a trivial principal $G$ bundle and\nwhich was used previously to solve completely Yang-Mills theory and the $G/G$\nmodel in two dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 1994 17:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

This representation\npermutes ``Gaussian'' elements in the fermion Fock space, and is necessarily\nprojective: we compute its cocycle at the group level, and obtain Schwinger\nterms and anomalies from infinitesimal versions of this cocycle. Quantization,\nin this framework, depends on the choice of the ``right'' complex structure on\nthe space of solutions of the Dirac equation. We show how the spin\nrepresentation allows one to compute exactly the S-matrix for fermions in an\nexternal field; the cocycle yields a causality condition needed to determine\nthe phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 1994 20:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}
