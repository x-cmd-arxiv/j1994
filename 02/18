The action is a general\ntwo-dimensional sigma model, corresponding to a closed string theory with a\nsecond order action in the Polyakov picture. The spacetime fields must have a\nsymmetry generated by a null, covariantly constant spacetime vector in order\nfor the light-cone gauge to be accessible. Also, the theory must be Weyl\ninvariant. The conditions for Weyl invariance are computed within the\nlight-cone gauge, reproducing the usual beta functions. The calculation of the\ndilaton beta function and the critical dimension is somewhat novel in this\nghost-free theory. Some exactly solvable light-cone theories are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 1994 22:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
