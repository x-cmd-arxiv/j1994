Extreme Horizontal Branch stars with $\\log g > 5$ and $\\log \\teff >\n20,000K$ have emerged in the last few years as the most likely candidate for\nthe origin of the UVX. The magnitude of this far-UV flux in some systems (e.g.\nNGC~1399, NGC~4649) indicates that galactic nuclear regions must contain larger\nnumbers of these subdwarfs than does the solar neighbourhood. This paper\nsummarizes the results of a quantitative study of the UV radiation from evolved\nstellar populations. We have computed a large grid of stellar models in\nadvanced stages of evolution, as well as a set of isochrones for ages 2-20 Gyr,\nfor a wide range in composition. We use these calculations to derive synthetic\nUV colour indices for stellar populations with hot components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 1994 20:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
