Non-deterministic dynamics may arise due to the failure\nof the Lipschitz condition in the equations of motion. At a singular point, the\nphase space trajectory of the system may jump from one solution to another.\nThis discontinous change implies divergence of the second derivative of the\nsolution whenever it passes near the singular point. A time series can be\nexamined for such divergences, which may indicate non-determinism in the\ndynamical system. Examples with both simulated and actual data are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 1994 21:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
