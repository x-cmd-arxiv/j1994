The degree to which we can\nconstrain any high redshift tail to the no evolution redshift distribution\ndepends on the distribution of dark matter in the most distant lensing cluster.\nIn the second paper in this series, we use the lensing signal to reconstruct\nthe full two-dimensional mass distribution in the clusters and, together with\nhigh resolution X-ray images, demonstrate that their structural properties are\nwell-understood.

We show that the global structure of the universe depends\ncrucially on the mechanism of inflation. In the simplest models of chaotic\ninflation the Universe looks like a sea of thermalized phase surrounding\npermanently self-reproducing inflationary domains. In the theories where\ninflation occurs near a local extremum of the effective potential corresponding\nto a metastable state, the Universe looks like de Sitter space surrounding\nislands of thermalized phase. A similar picture appears even if the state $\\phi\n= 0$ is unstable but the effective potential has a discrete symmetry $\\phi \\to\n=-\\phi$. In this case the Universe becomes divided into domains containing\ndifferent phases. These domains will be separated from each other by domain\nwalls. However, unlike ordinary domain walls, these domain walls will inflate,\nand their thickness will exponentially grow. In the theories with continuous\nsymmetries inflation generates exponentially expanding strings and monopoles\nsurrounded by thermalized phase. Inflating topological defects will be stable,\nand they will unceasingly produce new inflating topological defects. This means\nthat topological defects may play a role of indestructible seeds for eternal\ninflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 1994 16:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
