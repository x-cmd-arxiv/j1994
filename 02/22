We emphasize the simplifying features of dimension three\nand supply more robust methods that do not rely on such special characteristics\nand hence naturally generalize to other dimensions. The moduli spaces for\nCalabi--Yau $d$-folds are somewhat different from the ``special K\\\"ahler\nmanifolds'' which had occurred for $d=3$, and we indicate the new geometrical\nstructures which arise. We formulate and apply procedures which allow for the\nconstruction of mirror maps and the calculation of order-by-order instanton\ncorrections to Yukawa couplings. Mathematically, these corrections are expected\nto correspond to calculating Chern classes of various parameter spaces (Hilbert\nschemes) for rational curves on Calabi--Yau manifolds. Our results agree with\nthose obtained by more traditional mathematical methods in the limited number\nof cases for which the latter analysis can be carried out. Finally, we make\nexplicit some striking relations between instanton corrections for various\nYukawa couplings, derived from the associativity of the operator product\nalgebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 1994 23:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-11"}

The `null' property of the generators (${\\rm Tr }(N_n\nN_m)=0$) implies the consistency of the gauging and the absence of\n$\\a'$-corrections to the semiclassical backgrounds obtained from the gauged\nWZNW models. In the case of the maximally non-compact groups ($G= SL(3),\nSO(2,2), SO(2,3), G_2$) the construction corresponds to gauging some of the\nsubgroups generated by the nilpotent `step' operators in the Gauss\ndecomposition. The rank 2 case is a particular example of a general\nconstruction leading to conformal backgrounds with one time-like direction. The\nconformal theories obtained by integrating out the gauge field can be\nconsidered as sigma model analogs of Toda models (their classical equations of\nmotion are equivalent to Toda model equations).
