Interferometric spectral-line observations of R Aqr and H1-36 Arae have\nrevealed a 22-GHz water maser in the former and 1612-MHz hydroxyl and weak\n22-GHz water maser emission from the latter. H1-36 has thus become the first\nknown symbiotic OH/IR star. We have also detected weak OH line emission from\nthe vicinity of R Aqr, but we note that there are small discrepencies between\nthe OH- and H2O-line velocities and positions. These detections demonstrate\nunequivocally that dust can shield some circumstellar hydroxyl and water\nmolecules from dissociation, even in systems which possess intense local\nsources of UV. Finally, we discuss some of the implications of these\nobservations. The narrow profile of the water maser in R Aqr means that there\nmay finally be an opportunity to determine the system's orbital parameters. We\nalso point out that high resolution synthesis observations may trace the\ndistribution of dust in H1-36 and R Aqr, possibly throwing light on the\nmass-loss process in symbiotic Miras and placing constraints on the amount of\ncollimation experienced by UV radiation from their hot, compact companions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 1994 23:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

It has been\nsuggested that these OH/IR colour mimics must have a degenerate companion which\ndissociates OH molecules and disrupts the masing action, ie. that they are\nrelated to symbiotic Miras. Coincidentally, there is a paucity of long-period\nsymbiotic Miras and symbiotic OH/IR stars. Phenomonologically, those that are\nknown seem to cluster in the zone where field Miras transform into OH/IR stars.\nIf it could be proven that OH/IR colour mimics contain a degenerate star, that\nobservable evidence of this star is hidden from view by CS dust whilst it\nslowly accretes from the wind of its Mira companion, then we have an excellent\nexplanation for not only the existence of OH/IR colour mimics, but also for the\nlow observed frequency of symbiotic OH/IR stars and the common occurrence of\nvery slow novae in long-period symbiotic Miras. Here, we employ radio continuum\nradiation (which should escape unhindered from within the dust shells) as a\nsimple probe of the postulated hot degenerate companions which would inevitably\nionize a region of their surrounding gas. We compare the radio and infrared\nproperties of the colour mimics with those of normal symbiotic Miras, using the\nstrong correlation between radio and mid-IR emission in symbiotic stars. We\nshow that if a hot companion exists then, unlike their symbiotic counterparts,\nthey must produce radiation-bounded nebulae.

More controversial, however, is the proposal of the\nsame authors [\\GJ, p. 160] to let `$[z^n/n!] G(z)$' denote the coefficient of\n$z^n/n!$, i.e., $n!$ times the coefficient of $z^n$. An alternative\ngeneralization of $[z^n] G(z)$, in which we define $[F(z)] G(z)$ to be a linear\nfunction of both $F$ and $G$, seems to be more useful because it facilitates\nalgebraic manipulations. The purpose of this paper is to explore some of the\nproperties of such a definition. The remarks are dedicated to Tony Hoare\nbecause of his lifelong interest in the improvement of notations that\nfacilitate manipulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 1994 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
