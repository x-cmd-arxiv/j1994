The tools\nrequired to establish this correspondence are provided by the classical\ndifferential geometry of surfaces. A constant-mean-curvature surface induces a\nsolution to the O(3) model through the identification of the Gauss map, or\nnormal vector, of the surface with the field vector of the sigma model. Some\nexplicit solutions, including the solitons and antisolitons discovered by\nBelavin and Polyakov, and a more general solution due to Purkait and Ray, are\nconsidered and the surfaces giving rise to them are found explicitly. It is\nseen, for example, that the Belavin-Polyakov solutions are induced by the Gauss\nmaps of surfaces which are conformal to their spherical images, i.e. spheres\nand minimal surfaces, and that the Purkait-Ray solution corresponds to the\nfamily of constant-mean-curvature helicoids first studied by do Carmo and\nDajczer in 1982. A generalisation of this method to include time-dependence may\nshed new light on the role of the Hopf invariant in this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 1994 12:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
