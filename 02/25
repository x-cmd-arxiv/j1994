Subsequently we construct the invariant noncommutative\nplanes associated with $ {\\tilde G}_{r,s}$ algebra and show how the two well\nknown Manin planes corresponding to $GL_{p,q}(2)$ quantum group can easily be\nreproduced through such construction. Finally we consider the `coloured'\nextension of $GL_{p,q}(2)$ quantum group as well as corresponding Manin planes\nand explore their intimate connection with the `coloured' extension of ${\\tilde\nG}_{r,s}$ Hopf structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 1994 11:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

The aim is to realize\nhigher order non-unitary conformal field theories in a simple Ising-type spin\nmodel. We find that the first ground-state level crossing in the\nhigh-temperature phase leads to a second-order phase transition of the Yang-Lee\nuniversality class (central charge $c=-22/5$). The Yang-Lee transition region\nends at a line of a new type of tricriticality, where the {\\em three} lowest\nenergy levels become degenerate. The analysis of the spectrum at two points on\nthis line gives good evidence that this line belongs to the universality class\nof the ${\\cal M}_{2,7}$-conformal theory with $c=-68/7$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 1994 10:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The notion of\nisotopic equivalence is defined in order to evaluate the equivalence of these\nmodels to earlier one-component models. All the one-component models considered\nin earlier papers are shown to be equivalent to a particular class of\ntwo-component models. A simplified model applicable to the case of nuclear\nfragmentation is introduced and analyzed.
