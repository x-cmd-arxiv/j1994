Since\nquarks are unobservable one can suggest different definitions of $m_Q$. One of\nthe most popular choices is the pole quark mass routinely used in perturbative\ncalculations and in some analyses based on heavy quark expansions. We show that\nno precise definition of the pole mass can be given in the full theory once\nnon-perturbative effects are included. Any definition of this quantity suffers\nfrom an intrinsic uncertainty of order $\\Lam /m_Q$. This fact is succinctly\ndescribed by the existence of an infrared renormalon generating a factorial\ndivergence in the high-order coefficients of the $\\alpha_s$ series; the\ncorresponding singularity in the Borel plane is situated at $2\\pi /b$. A\npeculiar feature is that this renormalon is not associated with the matrix\nelement of a local operator. The difference $\\La \\equiv M_{H_Q}-m_Q^{pole}$ can\nstill be defined in Heavy Quark Effective Theory, but only at the price of\nintroducing an explicit dependence on a normalization point $\\mu$: $\\La (\\mu\n)$. Fortunately the pole mass $m_Q(0)$ {\\em per se} does not appear in\ncalculable observable quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 1994 06:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}
