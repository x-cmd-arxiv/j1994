We find the analytical\npredictions for the halo mass function, merger rates and formation times to be\nremarkably accurate. The analytical model is however expected to apply for\narbitrary Omega and general power spectra. Dark matter halos were identified in\nthe simulations using two different methods. For halos selected at mean\noverdensities 100-200, the analytical mass function was found to provide a good\nfit to the simulations with a collapse threshold close to that predicted by the\nspherical collapse model, with a typical error of <30% over a range of 1000 in\nmass, which is the full dynamic range of our N-body simulations. This was\ninsensitive to the type of filtering used. Over a range of 100 - 1000 in mass,\nthere was also good agreement with the analytical predictions for merger rates,\nincluding their dependence on the masses of the two halos involved and the time\ninterval being considered, and for formation times, including the dependence on\nhalo mass and formation epoch. The analytical Press-Schechter mass function and\nits extension to halo lifetimes and merger rates thus provide a very useful\ndescription of the growth of dark matter halos through hierarchical clustering,\nand should providea valuable tool in studies of the formation and evolution of\ngalaxies and galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 1994 09:19:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 1994 09:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
