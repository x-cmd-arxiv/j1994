The one-loop\ncounterterms of the general theory are found. The renormalization group\nequations corresponding to two different, multiplicatively renormalizable\nvariants of the same are derived. The analysis of their asymptotic solutions\nshows that, depending on the sign of one of the coupling constants, we can\nconstruct an asymptotically free theory which is also asymptotically conformal\ninvariant at strong (or small) curvature. The connection that can be\nestablished between one of the multiplicatively renormalizable variants of the\ntheory and the effective theory of the conformal factor, aiming at the\ndescription of quantum gravity at large distances, is investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 1994 17:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 1994 08:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}
