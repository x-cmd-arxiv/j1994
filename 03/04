In certain regions of the coupling constant\nspace the model must be defined via analytical continuation. We show in detail\nhow this works for the Penner model. Using analytical continuation it is\npossible to reach the fermionic 1-matrix model. We show that the critical\npoints of the fermionic 1-matrix model can be indexed by an integer, $m$, as it\nwas the case for the ordinary hermitian 1-matrix model. Furthermore the $m$'th\nmulti-critical fermionic model has to all genera the same value of\n$\\gamma_{str}$ as the $m$'th multi-critical hermitian model. However, the\ncoefficients of the topological expansion need not be the same in the two\ncases.

One main point is\nto include chiral operators with fractional quantum group spins (fourth or\nsixth of integers) which are needed to achieve modular invariance. We extend\nthe study of the chiral bootstrap (recently completed by E. Cremmer, and the\npresent authors) to the case of semi-infinite quantum-group representations\nwhich correspond to positive integral screening numbers. In particular, we\nprove the Bidenharn-Elliot and Racah identities for q-deformed 6-j symbols\ngeneralized to continuous spins. The decoupling of the family of physical\nchiral operators (with real conformal weights) at the special values\nC_{Liouville}= =7, 13, and 19, is shown to provide a full solution of Moore and\nSeiberg's equations, only involving operators with real conformal weights.\nMoreover, our study confirms the existence of the strongly coupled topological\nmodels. The three-point functions are shown to be given by a product of leg\nfactors similar to the ones of the weakly coupled models. However, contrary to\nthis latter case, the equality between the quantum group spins of the\nholomorphic and antiholomorphic components is not preserved by the local vertex\noperator. Thus the ``c=1'' barrier appears as connected with a deconfinement of\nchirality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 1994 13:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
