In contrast, the 12CO/13CO line ratio obtained\nfrom single dish data is 10.0+/-0.9, significantly higher than Galactic values\nbut in good agreement with line ratios measured in other galaxies. The\ninterferometer map of MC20 reveals that the cloud has similar spatial and\nvelocity extents in the two lines, and thus the high single dish line ratio\ncannot be due to different filling factors in the two lines. In addition, the\nsingle dish data show no evidence for significant variations in the line ratio\nwith metallicity, which eliminates abundance changes as the explanation for the\nhigh single dish line ratio. We conclude that the high 12CO/13CO line ratio s\nobserved in M33, and in the disks of spiral galaxies in general, are due to the\npresence of a population of diffuse molecular clouds. The lower limit to the\nfraction of the total 12CO emission from M33 that originates in the diffuse\nclouds is 30+/-30%, while the upper limit is ~60%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 1994 16:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
