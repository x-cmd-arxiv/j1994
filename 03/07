Inside $1.5 R_e$ the surface density profiles depend strongly on the\ninitial conditions and are in general not in agreement with the de Vaucouleurs\nlaw. This result is in contradiction to the observations which show that all\nelliptical galaxies have de Vaucouleurs profiles inside $1.5 R_e$ and show\nstrong deviations outside $1.5 R_e$. The $r^{1/4}$-profiles of E-galaxies are\ntherefore not a direct result of collisionless violent relaxation and angular\nmomentum redistribution. It is rather a universal initial density profile which\nis required in order to explain the universal structure of E-galaxies. A new\nmodel for the formation of E-galaxies is presented which assumes that\nellipticals and bulges formed from isothermal, gaseous spheres which\naccumulated in the core regions of dark matter halos and condensed into stars\nthrough a cooling instability. This scenario predicts that early type galaxies\ntrace directly the core radii and core masses of their dark matter halos,\nproviding important information on the nature of the dark matter component in\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 1994 11:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
