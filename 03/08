In the absence of a definitive model for\nconvection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these\noscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must\nbe estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements,\neven this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude.\n  This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude\nof oscillations (dL/L) can be derived from the velocity amplitude v_osc. Using\nlinear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a\nlarge sample of pulsating stars satisfy\n  (dL/L)_bol proportional to v_osc/T_eff. Using this relationship, together\nwith the best estimate of v_osc(Sun) = (23.4 +/- 1.4) cm/s, we estimate the\nluminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550 nm to be dL/L = (4.7 +/- 0.3)\nppm.\n  Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e.,\nconvectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only\npredictions come from model calculations by (Christensen-Dalsgaard & Frandsen,\nSol. Phys. 82, 469).

These involutions correspond\nrespectively to two kinds of transformations on $q \\times q$ matrices: the\ninversion of the $q \\times q$ matrix and an (involutive) permutation of the\nentries of the matrix. We concentrate on the case where these permutations are\nelementary transpositions of two entries. In this case the birational\ntransformations fall into six different classes. For each class we analyze the\nfactorization properties of the iteration of these transformations. These\nfactorization properties enable to define some canonical homogeneous\npolynomials associated with these factorization properties. Some mappings yield\na polynomial growth of the complexity of the iterations. For three classes the\nsuccessive iterates, for $q=4$, actually lie on elliptic curves. This analysis\nalso provides examples of integrable mappings in arbitrary dimension, even\ninfinite. Moreover, for two classes, the homogeneous polynomials are shown to\nsatisfy non trivial non-linear recurrences. The relations between\nfactorizations of the iterations, the existence of recurrences on one or\nseveral variables, as well as the integrability of the mappings are analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 1994 16:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
