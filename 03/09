The quantisation of first class systems, it may be mentioned, is already\nwell founded. We show how the usual analysis of Batalin-Tyutin may be\ngeneralised, particularly if one is dealing with nonabelian theories. In order\nto gain a deeper insight into the formalism we have considered two specific\nexamples of second class theories-- the massive Maxwell theory (Proca model)\nand its nonabelian extension. The first class constraints and the involutive\nHamiltonian are explicitly constructed. The connection of our Hamiltonian\napproach with the usual Lagrangian formalism is elucidated. For the Proca model\nwe reveal the importance of a boundary term which plays a significant role in\nestablishing an exact identification of the extra fields in the Batalin-Tyutin\napproach with the St\\\"uckelberg scalar. Some comments are also made concerning\nthe corresponding identification in the nonabelian example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 1994 15:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
