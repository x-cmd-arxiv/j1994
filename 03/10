We consider the scattering and\ncapture of the spherically symmetric mode of a charged, massive test field on\nthe background spacetime of a black hole with charge $Q$ and mass $M$. The\nspacetime geometry near the horizon of a $|Q|=M$ black hole has a scaling\nsymmetry, which is absent if $|Q|<M$, a scale being introduced by the surface\ngravity. We show that this symmetry leads to the existence of a self-similiar\nsolution for the charged field near the horizon, and further, that there is a\none parameter family of discretely self-similiar solutions . The scaling\nsymmetry, or lack thereof, also shows up in correlation length scales, defined\nin terms of the rate at which the influence of an external source coupled to\nthe field dies off. It is shown by constructing the Greens functions, that an\nexternal source has a long range influence on the extremal background, compared\nto a correlation length scale which falls off exponentially fast in the $|Q|<M$\ncase.
