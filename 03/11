The paper contains 2\nchapters: 1st is devoted to the infinite dimensional geometry of flag,\nfundamental and $\\Pi$-spaces for Virasoro-Bott group and its nonassociative\ndeformation defined by Gelfand-Fuchs 3-cocycle (Gelfand-Fuchs loop) as well as\nof infinite-dimensional non-Euclidean symplectic grassmannian, to the\nconstructions of Verma modules, their models and skladens over Virasoro\nalgebra; an infinite dimensional geometry of the configuration space for the\nsecond quantized free string in flat and curved backgrounds as well as author\nversion of Bowick- Rajeev formalism of the separation of internal and external\ndegrees of freedom of a closed string are described in 2nd chapter. In the 1st\nchapter the main objects are infinite dimensional Lie algebras, groups and\nloops, homogeneous, K\\\"ahler, Finsler, contact and symmetric spaces, complex,\nreal and CR-manifolds, determinant sheaves, manifolds with subsymmetries,\npolarizations and Fock spaces, bibundles and objects of integral geometry,\nnonholonomic spaces, deformations of geometric structures and moduli spaces. In\nthe 2nd chapter they are gauge fields, Faddeev-Popov ghosts, Gauss-Manin\nconnections, Kostant-Blattner-Sternberg pairings, BRST-operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 1994 12:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 1994 08:56:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 1994 14:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
