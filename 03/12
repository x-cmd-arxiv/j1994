In\nprinciple, the scatterers can provide views of the line-emitting gas from\ndifferent directions, allowing the 3-d velocity field of the emitting gas to be\ndetermined and revealing sources which are hidden from direct view.\nUnfortunately, as in a Hall of Mirrors, the resultant multiple images can be\nconfusing and hard to interpret. In general, the scattering geometry will be\nunknown, which makes it difficult to disentangle the effect of the motion of\nthe scatterers from that of the motion of the emitting source. In this\nsituation, spectropolarimetric observations can be a great help, since the\nscattered light will be partially polarised to a degree dependent on the angle\nof scattering and on the details of the scattering process. Analysis of the\npolarisation profiles of the scattered emission lines can then determine the\nrelative orientation and velocity of the source and the scatterers.
