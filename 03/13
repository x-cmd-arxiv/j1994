In this\napproach pancaking is the predominant form of first collapsing objects.\nRelativistic counterparts of these equations contain the electric and magnetic\nparts of the Weyl tensor. In the linear theory the magnetic part is associated\nwith gravitational waves. If the magnetic part is ignored, then the newtonian\nlimit of the relativistic equations is reduced to the closed set of the local\nLagrangian equations. Recently this fact drew much attention since the\ngravitational instability in that form would greatly simplify the study of\ncosmic structure formation. In particular, the filamentary structure of\ncollapsing is predicted. In this paper we resolve the contradiction between the\nnewtonian theory and relativistic version adopted in some recent papers. We\nshow that dropping the magnetic part from the basic relativistic equations is\n{\\it incorrect}. The correct newtonian limit is derived by the $1/c$-expansion\nof the GR equations and the Bianchi identities for the Weyl tensor. The last\nones begin with $\\sim 1/c^3$ order, therefore one {\\it must} take into account\nthe magnetic part in the post newtonian order $\\sim 1/c^3$, which contains\nnon-local terms, related to the non-local gravitational interaction. For the\nfirst time we rigorously show that the GR equations with the magnetic part are\nreduced precisely to the canonic newtonian non-local equations. Thus, the\ncorrect treatment of the relativistic version of the gravitational instability\nresurrects the canonic picture of the structure formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 1994 11:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The relevance of these results for the information\nproblem and for the issue of back reaction is discussed. In the `strong\ncoupling' regime, $\\Lambda>(\\hbar G)^{-2}$ a full fledged quantum gravity\ntreatment is required. Since the total energy of thermal states in anti-de\nSitter space with reflective boundary conditions at spatial infinity is bounded\nand conserved, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are well defined. For\na given temperature or energy black hole states are locally stable. In the weak\ncoupling regime black hole states are more probable then pure radiation states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 1994 13:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
