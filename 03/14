As an example we present the results for the case of\n``Hot-Dark-Matter\" (HDM) initial conditions (with scale-free $n = 1$ power\nindex on large scales and $\\Omega = 1$) as a representative of models with\nsufficient large-scale power. We use an analytic approximation for particle\ntrajectories of a self-gravitating dust continuum and apply a local dynamical\nbiasing of volume elements to identify luminous matter in the model. Using this\nmethod, we are able to resolve formally a simulation box of 1200h^-1 Mpc (e.g.\nfor HDM initial conditions) down to the scale of galactic halos using $2160^3$\nparticles. Pencil beam probes are taken for a given epoch using the parameters\nof observed beams. In particular, our analysis concentrates on the detection of\na quasi-periodicity in the beam probes. The simulation is designed for\napplication to parameter studies which prepare future observational projects.\nWe find that a large percentage of the beams shows quasi-periodicities with\nperiods which cluster at a certain length scale. The periods found range\nbetween one and eight times the cutoff length in the initial fluctuation\nspectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 1994 11:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
