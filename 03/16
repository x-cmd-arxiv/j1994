Solutions are given at second order in perturbation theory for the\nrelevant fluid and geometric quantities and compared with the corresponding\nones in the Newtonian approximation. Specifically, we compute the density, the\nvolume expansion scalar, the shear, the ``electric\" part, or tide, and the\n``magnetic\" part of the Weyl tensor. The evolution of the shear and the tide\nbeyond the linear regime strongly depends on the ratio of the characteristic\nsize of the perturbation to the cosmological horizon distance. For\nperturbations on sub--horizon scales the usual Newtonian approximation applies,\nat least at the considered perturbative order; on super--horizon scales,\ninstead, a new picture emerges, which we call ``silent universe\", as each fluid\nelement evolves independently of the environment, being unable to exchange\nsignals with the surrounding matter through either sound waves or gravitational\nradiation. For perturbations inside the Hubble radius particular attention is\npaid in singling out non--local effects during the non--linear evolution of\nfluid elements. These non--local effects are shown to be carried by a traceless\nand divergenceless tensor, contained in the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor,\nwhich is dynamically generated as soon as the system evolves away from the\nlinear regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 1994 17:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

I show that for certain values of the\nsupersymmetric parameters the standard QCD loop corrections to this decay mode\nare diminished or enhanced by several 10 per cent. I show that not only a small\nvalue of 3 GeV for the gluino mass (small mass window) but also much larger\nvalues of several hundreds of GeV's have a non-neglible effect on this decay\nrate, against general belief. Last but not least, if the ratio of the vacuum\nexpectation values of the Higgs bosons are taken in the limit of $v_1\\ll v_2$ I\nobtain a drastic enhancement due to a $\\tan\\beta$\\ dependence in the couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 1994 05:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 May 1994 04:15:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 1994 22:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}
