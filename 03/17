In the large\n$k$ limit there is a second conformal point in the vicinity of the ultarviolet\nfixed point. At the second critical point the conformal model has a rational\nVirasoro central charge which no longer corresponds to a coset construction. In\nspite of this fact the perturbative conformal model appears to be a unitary\nsystem as long as the underlying coset construction at the ultraviolet critical\npoint is unitary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 1994 12:33:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 1994 10:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
