I investigate possible proton\ndecay due to additional color triplets in the massless spectrum and due to\nnonrenormalizable terms.

We\nshow that the effective coupling constant $k$ induced by radiative corrections\ndepends crucially on the balance between the ultraviolet behavior of scalar and\npseudoscalar terms in the regularized action. There are three different\nregimes. When the ultraviolet leading term is scalar the coupling $k$ is\nshifted to $k+h^{\\vee}$.However, if the leading term is pseudoscalar the shift\nis $k+s h^{\\vee}$ with $s=0$ or $s=2$ depending on the sign of such a term. In\nthe borderline case when the scalar and pseudoscalar terms have the same\nultraviolet behavior the shift of $k$ becomes arbitrary (even non-integer) and\ndepends on the parameters of the regularization. We also show that the\ncoefficient of the induced gravitational Chern-Simons term is different for the\nthree regimes and has the same universality properties than the effective\ncoupling constant $k$.
