We find that the redshift space two-point correlation function is\nwell approximated by a power-law of slope -1.11+\\-0.09, with clustering length\n3.87+\\-0.32 Mpc/h out to pair separations of 25 Mpc\\h. On scales larger than 40\nMpc/h, the correlation function is consistent with zero. The r.m.s. fluctuation\nin the count of QDOT galaxies above the Poisson level in spheres of radius 8\nMpc/h is \\sigma_8^{IRAS}=0.58+\\-0.14, showing that fluctuations in the\ndistribution of IRAS galaxies on these scales are smaller than those of optical\ngalaxies by a factor of about 0.65, with an uncertainty of 25%. We find no\ndetectable difference between the correlation functions measured in redshift\nspace and in real space, leading to a $2\\sigma$ limit of b_{IRAS}/\\Omega^{0.6}\n>1.05, where b_{IRAS} is the bias factor for IRAS galaxies and \\Omega is the\ncosmological density parameter. The QDOT autocorrelation function calculated in\nconcentric shells increases significantly with shell radius. This difference is\nmore likely due to sampling fluctuations than to an increase of the clustering\nstrength with galaxy luminosity, but the two effects are difficult to\ndisentangle; our data allow at most an increase of \\sim 20% in clustering\nstrength for each decade in luminosity. For separations greater than \\sim 3\nMpc/h, the cross-correlation function of Abell clusters (with Richness R\\ge 1)\nand QDOT galaxies is well approximated by a power-law of slope -1.81+\\-0.10,\nwith clustering length 10.10+\\-0.45 Mpc/h, and no significant signal beyond\n\\gsim 50 Mpc\\h. This cross-correlation depends only weakly on cluster richness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 1994 01:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
