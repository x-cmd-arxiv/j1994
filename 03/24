This is the basis of the very convincing and important\nargument that baryons can contribute at most 10\\% of critical density and thus\ncannot close the Universe. Nonstandard scenarios involving decaying\nparticles,$^1$ inhomogeneities in the baryon density,$^2$ and even more exotic\nideas$^3$ put forth to evade this bound have been largely unsuccessful.$^4$ We\nsuggest a new way of relaxing the bound: If the tau neutrino has a mass of\n$20\\MeV-30\\MeV$ and lifetime of $200\\sec -1000\\sec$, and its decay products\ninclude electron neutrinos, the bound to the baryon mass density can be\nloosened by a about factor of $10$. The key is the decay-generated electron\nantineutrinos: around the time of nucleosynthesis they are captured by protons\nto produce neutrons, thereby changing the outcome of nucleosynthesis.\nExperiments at $e^\\pm$ colliders should soon be sensitive to a tau-neutrino\nmass in the required range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 1994 17:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
