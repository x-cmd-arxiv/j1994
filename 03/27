The clouds are developed\nfrom linear perturbations at high redshift and exposed to either a QSO- or\ngalaxy-dominated metagalactic radiation field at moderate redshifts. While the\nemphasis is on spherical systems, slab symmetry is also considered. Three zones\nmay be identified in a collapsed cloud: (1) a quasi-hydrostatic core in thermal\nequilibrium, (2) a nonhydrostatic intermediate zone out of thermal equilibrium,\nand (3) a cosmological accretion layer joining onto the Hubble expansion. Most\nof the measured Lya forest column densities arise in the intermediate zone. The\ndevelopment of the core would result in a flattening in the column density\ndistribution near an HI column density of 10**15-10**16 cm**-2. The cloud\ndiameters corresponding to an HI column density of 10**14 cm**-2 lie in the\nrange 10-60 kpc, while systems with column densities exceeding 10**15 cm**-2\nhave diameters smaller than 10 kpc. Systems with circular velocities exceeding\n50 km/s result in clouds which contract until they become Jeans unstable and\ncollapse. The critical column density for collapse is 10**17-10**18 cm**-2. A\nmild correlation of Doppler parameter with neutral hydrogen column density is\nfound in several models for systems with column densities less than 10**13.5\ncm**-2, with Doppler parameters occurring as low as b > 20 km/s for 10**13\ncm**-2 column density systems. No lines with b < 15 km/s are found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 1994 22:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
