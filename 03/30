This is the multisymplectic generalization of the Hamiltonian\nformalism in mechanics. In field theory, multimomentum canonical variables are\nfield functions and momenta corresponding to derivatives of fields with respect\nall world coordinates, not only the time. In case of regular Lagrangian\ndensities, the multimomentum Hamiltonian formalism is equivalent to the\nLagrangian formalism, otherwise for degenerate Lagrangian densities. In this\ncase, the Euler-Lagrange equations become undetermined and require additional\nconditions which remain elusive. In the framework of the multimomentum\nHamiltonian machinery, one obtaines them automatically as a part of Hamilton\nequations. The key point consists in the fact that, given a degenerate\nLagrangian density, one must consider a family of associated multimomentum\nHamiltonian forms in order to exaust solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations.\nWe spell out degenerate quadratic and affine Lagrangian densities. The most of\nfield models are of these types.
