We pin down origin and size\nof the nonlocality in the Bonn potential, in analytic and numeric form. The\nnonlocality is due to the use of the correct off-shell Feynman amplitude of\none-boson-exchange avoiding the commonly used on-shell approximations which\nyield the local potentials. We also illustrate how this off-shell behavior\nleads to more binding energy. We emphasize that the increased binding energy is\nnot due to on-shell differences (differences in the fit of the NN data or phase\nshifts). In particular, the Bonn-B potential reproduces accurately the\n$\\epsilon_1$ mixing parameter up to 350 MeV as determined in the recent\nNijmegen multi-energy NN phase-shift analysis. Adding the relativistic effect\nfrom the relativistic nucleon propagators in the Faddeev equations, brings the\nBonn-B result up to 8.2 MeV triton binding. This leaves a difference of only\n0.3 MeV to experiment, which may possibly be explained by refinements in the\ntreatment of relativity and the inclusion of other nonlocalities (e.~g.,\nquark-gluon exchange at short range). Thus, it is conceivable that a realistic\nNN potential which describes the NN data up to 300 MeV correctly may explain\nthe triton binding energy without recourse to 3-N forces; relativity would play\na major role for this result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 1994 20:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
