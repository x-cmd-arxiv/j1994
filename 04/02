Dielectric model\ncalculations are implemented to check that these models produce that\ncharacteristic structure of contact and solvent-separated minima for oppositely\ncharged ions in water under physiological thermodynamic conditions. Comparison\nof the dielectric model results with the most current molecular level\ninformation indicates that the dielectric model does not, however, provide an\naccurate description of these potentials-of-mean-force. We note that linear\ndielectric models correspond to modelistic implementations of second-order\nthermodynamic perturbation theory for the excess chemical potential of a\ndistinguished solute molecule. Therefore, the molecular theory corresponding to\nthe dielectric models is second-order thermodynamic perturbation theory for\nthat excess chemical potential. The second-order, or fluctuation, term raises a\ntechnical computational issue of treatment of long-ranged interactions similar\nto the one which arises in calculation of the dielectric constant of the\nsolvent. It is contended that the most important step for further development\nof dielectric models would be a separate assessment of the first-order\nperturbative term (equivalently the {\\it potential at zero charge} ) which\nvanishes in the dielectric models but is generally nonzero. Parameterization of\nradii and molecular volumes should then be based of the second-order\nperturbative term alone.

This literature is\nreviewed here with the goal of offering an introduction to the subject within a\nconvenient, unified framework. It is shown that the null-plane Hamiltonian for\nfree massive fermions is chirally symmetric, provided only that the particles\nhave equal masses ($SU(3)$ limit). In the free quark model, hadrons can be\nclassified by a chiral $SU(3)\\otimes SU(3)$ algebra, the generators of which\nare current lightlike charges. Naturally, QCD interactions break chiral\nsymmetry, and the axial nonsinglet charges are not conserved. This remains true\nin the 'chiral limit' (zero quark masses), signalling the spontaneous breakdown\nof chiral symmetry. The actual generators of the $SU(3)\\otimes SU(3)$\nclassification of physical hadrons are obtained from the current charges by\nmeans of a unitary transformation. Under this transformation, quarks of the\nsame flavor and of opposite helicities mix to form a constituent quark. The\nfunctional form of this unitary transformation can be strongly constrained on\nthe basis of symmetry arguments. This analysis is potentially rich in\nphenomenological applications, and a few are presented here. The author offers\nalso some new theoretical results.
