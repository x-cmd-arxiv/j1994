In more\ndetail, let C be be the class of simple C*-algebras A which are direct limits A\n= lim A_k, in which each A_k is a finite direct sum of algebras of the form\nC(X) \\otimes M_n \\otimes O_m, where m is even, O_m is the Cuntz algebra, X is\neither a point, a compact interval, or the circle S^1, and each map A_k ---> A\nis approximately absorbing. (\"Approximately absorbing\" is defined in Section 1\nof the paper.) We show that two unital C*-algebras A and B in the class C are\nisomorphic if and only if (K_0 (A), [1_A], K_1 (A)) is isomorphic to (K_0 (B),\n[1_B], K_1 (B)). This class is large enough to exhaust all possible K-groups:\nif G_0 and G_1 are countable odd torsion groups and g is in G_0, then there is\na C*-algebra A in C with (K_0 (A), [1_A], K_1 (A)) isomorphic to (G_0, g, G_1).\nThe class C contains the tensor products of irrational rotation algebras with\neven Cuntz algebras. It is also closed under several natural operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 1994 06:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Jul 1995 02:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
