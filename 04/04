The instrument combines non-redundant masking with\nwavelength dispersion and is able to record fringes simultaneously over a wide\nbandwidth. For typical observations centred near 600 nm, the bandwidth is 55 nm\nand the spectral resolution is 3 nm. This paper describes the instrument and\nthe data processing methods and presents some results. We find the star sigma\nSgr to be a close binary; the system is only partially resolved, with a\nseparation of (11.5 +/- 2) milliarcsec (assuming the components to have equal\nmagnitudes). We also give angular diameter measurements of two red giant stars,\nalpha Sco and beta Gru. The observations of beta Gru (spectral type M5 III)\nresolve the star for the first time and give an equivalent uniform-disk\ndiameter of (27 +/- 3) milliarcsec.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 1994 15:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

In previous work,\nthe definition of the transduction relation defined by a synchronous TAG was\ngiven by appeal to an iterative rewriting process. The rewriting definition of\nderivation is problematic in that it greatly extends the expressivity of the\nformalism and makes the design of parsing algorithms difficult if not\nimpossible. We introduce a simple, natural definition of synchronous\ntree-adjoining derivation, based on isomorphisms between standard\ntree-adjoining derivations, that avoids the expressivity and implementability\nproblems of the original rewriting definition. The decrease in expressivity,\nwhich would otherwise make the method unusable, is offset by the incorporation\nof an alternative definition of standard tree-adjoining derivation, previously\nproposed for completely separate reasons, thereby making it practical to\nentertain using the natural definition of synchronous derivation. Nonetheless,\nsome remaining problematic cases call for yet more flexibility in the\ndefinition; the isomorphism requirement may have to be relaxed. It remains for\nfuture research to tune the exact requirements on the allowable mappings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 1994 03:07:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 1994 23:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Taking advantage of\nthe fact that both isotropic and directed bond percolation (with one preferred\ndirection) may be mapped onto corresponding variants of (Reggeon) field theory,\nwe discuss the crossover between self--similar and self--affine scaling. This\nhas been a long--standing and yet unsolved problem because it is accompanied by\ndifferent upper critical dimensions: $d_c^{\\rm I} = 6$ for isotropic, and\n$d_c^{\\rm D} = 5$ for directed percolation, respectively. Using a generalized\nsubtraction scheme we show that this crossover may nevertheless be treated\nconsistently within the framework of renormalization group theory. We identify\nthe corresponding crossover exponent, and calculate effective exponents for\ndifferent length scales and the pair correlation function to one--loop order.\nThus we are able to predict at which characteristic anisotropy scale the\ncrossover should occur. The results are subject to direct tests by both\ncomputer simulations and experiment.
