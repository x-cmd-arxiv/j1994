We\nthen use the above formalism to derive expressions which hold in the case when\nthe doorway state approximation is introduced. In applying the theory we limit\nourselves in this work to the case when the parity violating potential and the\nstrong interaction are one-body. In this approximation, using as the doorway\nthe giant spin-dipole resonance and employing well known optical potentials and\na time-reversal even, parity odd one-body interaction we calculate or estimate\nthe terms we derived. In our calculations we explicitly orthogonalize the\ncontinuum and bound wave functions. We find the effects of orthogonalization to\nbe very important. Our conclusion is that the present one-body theory cannot\nexplain the average longitudinal asymmetry found in the recent polarized\nneutron experiments. We also confirm the discrepancy, first pointed out by\nAuerbach and Bowman, that emerges, between the calculated average asymmetry and\nthe parity violating spreading width, when distant doorways are used in the\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 1994 09:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
