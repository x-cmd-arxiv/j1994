The misalignment between the disk and the halo is a common\nexplanation for galactic disk warps, since in this state, disks have precessing\nbending modes which resemble real warps. A dubious assumption in this theory is\nthat the gravitational response of the halo is negligible. We therefore\ncalculate the response of an oblate halo to a precessing inclined exponential\ndisk using a variety of techniques. We construct models with a rigid\nexponential disk precessing in a particle halo, a particle disk precessing\ninside a static bulge/halo potential, and a self-consistent model with a\nparticle disk, bulge and halo. When the disk:halo mass ratio is small\n($\\sim$10\\%) within 5 exponential scale radii, the disk settles to the\nequatorial plane of the halo within 5 orbital times. When the disk and halo\nmass are comparable, the halo rapidly aligns with the disk within a few orbital\ntimes, while the disk inclination drops. The rapid response of the halo to a\ninclined disk suggests that the warps seen in galactic disks are not likely the\nbending modes of a precessing disk inside of triaxial halos. If a galaxy forms\ninclined to the principal plane of a dark halo, either the disk will settle to\na principal plane or the inner halo will twist to align with the disk. The\nouter halo will remain misaligned for a much longer time and therefore may\nstill exert a torque. Warped bending modes may still exist if the misalignment\nof the outer halo persists for a Hubble time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 1994 20:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
