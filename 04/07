Connection of Drinfeld's and\n  Cartan-Weyl realizations for quantum affine algebras","comments":"28 pages","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":"Preprint MPIM BONN, MPI/94-23","categories":"hep-th math.QA","license":null,"abstract":"  We show that some factors of the universal R-matrix generate a family of\ntwistings for the standard Hopf structure of any quantized contragredient Lie\n(super)algebra of finite growth. As an application we prove that any two\nisomorphic superalgebras with different Cartan matrices have isomorphic\nq-deformations (as associative superalgebras) and their standard\ncomultiplications are connected by such twisting. We present also an explicit\nrelation between the generators of the second Drinfeld's realization and\nCartan-Weyl generators of quantized affine nontwisted Kac-Moody algebras.\nFurther development of the theory of quantum Cartan-Weyl basis, closely related\nwith this isomorphism, is discussed. We show that Drinfeld's formulas of a\ncomultiplication for the second realization are a twisting of the standard\ncomultiplication by factors of the universal R-matrix. Finally, properties of\nthe Drinfeld's comultiplication are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 1994 12:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
