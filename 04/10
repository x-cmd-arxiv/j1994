In the case of\nmagnetic field perturbations, we propose a scaling theory for the spin-glass\nphase. Using the mean-field approach we argue that some pure states are\nsuppressed by the magnetic field and their free energy cost is determined by\nthe finite-temperature fixed point exponents. In this framework, numerical\nresults suggest that mean-field chaos exponents are probably exact in finite\ndimensions. If we use the droplet approach, numerical results suggest that the\nzero-temperature fixed point exponent $\\theta$ is very close to\n$\\frac{d-3}{2}$. In both approaches $d=3$ is the lower critical dimension in\nagreement with recent numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 1994 16:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
