Rather than adopting a mean mass\nfor the lensing objects we consider them distributed along a mass function\nsimilar to the disk one. Even if the number of microlensing events so far\ndetected is not large, we show that it is possible to constrain the fraction of\nmass density in the halo of our Galaxy in form of stars. We estimate that this\nfraction varies between 0.1 and 0.8, if halo stars trace the total halo mass\ndensity; in the opposite case this range becomes narrower. If lensing objects\nhave not been formed apart from the other halo stars, but in a more general\ncontext of star formation, neutron stars must also be present.

There probabilities\nare predicted for members of decoherent sets of alternative histories of the\nuniverse, ie ones for which the interference between pairs in the set is\nnegligible as measured by a decoherence functional. An expansion of the\ndecoherence functional in the separation between histories allows the form of\nthe deterministic equations of motion to be derived for suitable coarse\ngrainings of a class of non-relativistic systems, including ones with general\nnon-linear interactions. More coarse graining is needed to achieve classical\npredictability than naive arguments based on the uncertainty principle would\nsuggest. Coarse graining is needed for decoherence, and coarse graining beyond\nthat for the inertia necessary to resist the noise that mechanisms of\ndecoherence produce. Sets of histories governed largely by deterministic laws\nconstitute the quasiclassical realm of everyday experience which is an emergent\nfeature of the closed system's initial condition and Hamiltonian. We analyse\nthe sensitivity of the existence of a quasiclassical realm to the particular\nform of the initial condition.
