Coronography coupled\nwith adaptive optics on Hubble Space Telescope is a way to get both good\nspatial resolution and high dynamic range. However, because of the residual\nfigure errors on the primary and on the secondary, HST has a scattered light\nlevel that prevents it from detecting extra-solar planets. Our simulations show\nthat by using an active mirror (400-1000 actuators) in the optical path of HST\nwith adaptive optics, we can correct the mirror errors and decrease the\nscattering level by a factor $10^{2}$ (from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-6}$ fainter than\nthe star). Furthermore, by controlling the spatial frequencies of the active\nmirror with a {\\em dark hole\\/} algorithm we can decrease the scattering level\nin image zones where planet detection is likely. Using this technique, we have\nsucceeded in decreasing the scattering level to $3\\times 10^{-8}$ of the star\nintensity within 1 arcsec from the central star.
