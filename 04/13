Our calculations begin at the\nonset of core collapse and stop several 100 ms after the bounce, at which time\nsuccessful explosions of the appropriate magnitude have been obtained. (...)\nGuided by our numerical results, we have developed a paradigm for the supernova\nexplosion mechanism. We view a supernova as an open cycle thermodynamic engine\nin which a reservoir of low-entropy matter (the envelope) is thermally coupled\nand physically connected to a hot bath (the protoneutron star) by a neutrino\nflux, and by hydrodynamic instabilities. (...) In essence, a Carnot cycle is\nestablished in which convection allows out-of-equilibrium heat transfer\nmediated by neutrinos to drive low entropy matter to higher entropy and\ntherefore extracts mechanical energy from the heat generated by gravitational\ncollapse. We argue that supernova explosions are nearly guaranteed and\nself-regulated by the high efficiency of the thermodynamic engine. (...)\nConvection continues to accumulate energy exterior to the neutron star until a\nsuccessful explosion has occurred. At this time, the envelope is expelled and\ntherefore uncoupled from the heat source (the neutron star) and the energy\ninput ceases. This paradigm does not invoke new or modified physics over\nprevious treatments, but relies on compellingly straightforward thermodynamic\narguments. It provides a robust and self-regulated explosion mechanism to power\nsupernovae which is effective under a wide range of physical parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 1994 18:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
