The dynamics of the jet/cloud interaction is strongly\naffected by the cooling in the shocked gas behind the bow shock at the head of\nthe jet. We show that this cooling is very rapid, with the cooling distance of\nthe gas much less than the jet radius. Thus, although ambient gas is initially\ndriven away from the jet axis by the high thermal pressure odf the post-shock\ngas, rapid cooling reduces the pressure and the outflow subsequently evolves in\na momentum-conserving snowplow fashion. The velocity of the ambient gas is high\nin the vicinity of the jet head, but decreases rapidly as more material is\nswept up. Thus, this type of outflow produces extremely high velocity clumps of\npost shock gas which resemble the features seen in outflows. We have\ninvestigated the transfer of momentum from the jet to the ambient medium as a\nfunction of the jet parameters. We show that a low Mach number (<6) jet slows\ndown rapidly because it entrains ambient material along its sides. On the other\nhand, the beam of a high Mach number jet is separated from the ambient gas by a\nlow density cocoon of post-shock gas, and this jet transfers momentum to the\nambient medium principally at the bow-shock. In high Mach number jets, as those\nfrom young stellar objects, the dominant interaction is therefore at the bow\nshock at the head of the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 1994 14:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
