In a subsequent publication with a\nsimilar title Bahcall et al. (1994) have claimed to refute the results obtained\nby Dar and Shaviv. Here we show that the criticism and conclusions of Bahcall\net al. are unjustified. In particular, their attempts to reproduce the results\nof Dar and Shaviv failed because they did not use the same nuclear cross\nsections and did not include in their calculations major physics improvements\nwhich were included in the improved SSM code used by Dar and Shaviv.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 1994 15:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The latter then carries a simple\nsingularity, which resolves by a finite iteration of basic cycles of\ndeprojections. The homological intersection graph of this cycles is the Dynkin\ngraph of an ADE Lie group. The deformation of the simple singularity\ncorresponds to ADE symmetry breaking. A 3+1-dimensional topological model of\nobservation is constructed, transforming consistently under SL(2,C), as an\nevolving 3-dimensional system of world tubes, which connect ``possible points\nof observation\". The existence of an initial singularity for the 4-dimensional\nspace-time is related to its global topological structure. Associating the\ngeometry of ADE singularities to the vertex structure of the topological model\nputs forward the conjecture on a likewise relation of inner symmetries of\nelementary particles to local space-time structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 1994 10:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

This allows one to reduce any correlation function on orbifolds\nto a sum of more complicated correlation functions in the simpler theory on\nmanifolds. Chern-Simons theory on manifolds is known to be related to 2D CFT on\nclosed string surfaces; here I show that the theory on orbifolds is related to\n2D CFT of unoriented closed and open string models, i.e. to worldsheet orbifold\nmodels. In particular, the boundary components of the worldsheet correspond to\nthe components of the singular locus in the 3D orbifold. This correspondence\nleads to a simple identification of the open string spectra, including their\nChan-Paton degeneration, in terms of fusing Wilson lines in the corresponding\nChern-Simons theory. The correspondence is studied in detail, and some exactly\nsolvable examples are presented. Some of these examples indicate that it is\nnatural to think of the orbifold group $Z_2$ as a part of the gauge group of\nthe Chern-Simons theory, thus generalizing the standard definition of gauge\ntheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 1994 08:44:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 1994 20:30:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 1995 23:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-15"}
