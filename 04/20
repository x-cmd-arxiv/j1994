In agreement with the recent work of Gavela,\nHern\\'andez, Orloff and P\\`ene, we conclude that QCD damping effects reduce the\nasymmetry produced to a negligible amount. We interpret the damping as quantum\ndecoherence. We compute the asymmetry analytically. Our analysis reflects the\nobservation that only a thin, outer layer of the bubble contributes to the\ncoherent scattering of the quasiparticles. The generality of our arguments\nrules out any mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis that does not make use of a\nnew source of $CP$ violation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 1994 03:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}
