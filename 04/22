We show that a rich cluster observed at high redshift has had a\nsignificantly different evolutionary history to a cluster of the same richness\nobserved today. High redshift clusters take longer to assemble and thus under-\ngo more merging at small lookback times. We have investigated two models of\nstar formation in cluster galaxies: 1) a model in which star formation is\ninduced by galaxy-galaxy mergers and interactions and 2) a model in which star\nformation is regulated by the infall of galaxies onto larger systems such as\ngroups and clusters. Both models produce trends consistent with the Butcher-\nOemler effect. Our models of cluster formation and evolution allow us to make\npredictions about trends in the observed properties of clusters with redshift.\nWe find that there should be a correlation between the mass of the cluster or\ngroup and the strength of the observed Butcher-Oemler effect, with more massive\nsystems exhibiting more evolution than less massive systems. We also predict\nthat both the blue galaxy fraction and the incidence of interacting galaxies in\nrich clusters should rise continuously with redshift. Finally, we have explored\nthe influence of cosmological parameters on our predictions for cluster\nevolution. We find that models in which structure formation occurs at very\nearly epochs, such as low $\\Omega$ models, predict rather little recent star\nformation and merging activity in clusters at redshifts of around 0.4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 1994 23:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
