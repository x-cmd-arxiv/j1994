Dilute instanton systems behave as a free gas, while\ndense instanton systems behave as a plasma. The free gas behaviour is favored\nby a density of 1 fm$^{-4}$. Owing to the Higgs mechanism, the $\\eta$' mass is\nheavy (1100 MeV). The vacuum topological susceptibility is small (0.07\nfm$^{-4}$) and consistent with the QCD Ward identity. In the chiral limit, the\nsinglet screening vanishes, leading to a four dimensional plasma state with a\ntemperature given by the nonet decay constant $f$ (90 MeV). The phase is Debye\nscreened. In the presence of matter, the screening is quenched, and a\nKosterlitz-Thouless transition may occur signaling the restoration of the\n$U_A(1)$ symmetry. We suggest to use the spatial asymptotics of the static\ntopological charge correlator together with the topological susceptibility to\nprobe the interplay between the $U_A(1)$ restoration and the chiral restoration\nin finite temperature QCD.
