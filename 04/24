Numerical N-body simulations have\nbeen performed for radial and circular galactic orbits. The properties of the\nstars' zero--velocity surfaces in the perturbed galaxies are explored briefly,\nand the adiabaticity of the galaxy to the external field is discussed. For a\nchoice of parameters characteristic of rich clusters we find that the induced\nellipticity on a spherical galaxy is below or close to the detectability level.\nBut we find that the tidal torque can result in significant isophotal alignment\nof the galaxies' major axis with the cluster radial direction if the galaxy is\noutside the cluster core radius. The time required for the alignment is very\nshort compared with the Hubble time. A significant increase in the ellipticity\nof the outer isophotes of the prolate model is also found, but with no\nobservable isophotal twisting. Our main prediction is an alignment segregation\nof the elliptical galaxy population according to whether their orbits lie\nmostly outside or inside the cluster core radius. These results also suggest\nthat galactic alignment in rich clusters is not incompatible with a bottom-up\ngalaxy formation scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 1994 14:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The strongest\nmotivation for new neutrino physics comes from the complete phenomenological\nfailure of astrophysical solutions: (1) The standard solar model is excluded by\neach of the solar neutrino experiments.

(3) Even if\nthe Homestake results were ignored entirely, there is no realistic solar model\nso far that describes the Kamiokande and gallium data simultaneously within\ntheir experimental uncertainties. On the other hand, the MSW solutions provide\na complete description of the data, strongly hinting at the existence of mass\nand mixing of neutrinos. The MSW predictions for the future experiments are\ngiven in detail. It is stressed that solar model uncertainties are significant\nin determining the oscillation parameters and in making predictions for the\nfuture experiments.
