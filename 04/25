Here we\npresent the results of thermal evolution simulations based on two models of the\nvortex pinning forces that bracket a range of plausible pinning strengths. We\ninclude the effects of superfluidity, magnetic fields, and temperature\ngradients. As representative standard and accelerated neutrino emission\nprocesses taking place in the core, we consider the modified Urca process in\nnormal baryonic matter, and the much faster quark Urca process. Comparison of\nour results with neutron star surface temperature data, including the recent\ntemperature measurement of the Geminga pulsar, shows that stars with soft\nequations of state and modest frictional heating are in closest agreement with\nthe data; stars with stronger frictional heating have temperatures inconsistent\nwith the upper limit of PSR 1929+10. Stiffer stars undergoing standard cooling\ngenerally have temperatures lying above the Vela detection, a situation\nworsened by the inclusion of frictional heating. Stars undergoing accelerated\ncooling without frictional heating have temperatures that fall far below most\ntemperature measurements; the Vela and Geminga detections being the most\ncompelling examples. Only in stiff stars, which have thick crusts, can the\ninclusion of strong frictional heating raise the temperature at late stages in\nthe evolution to a level consistent with the data. However, such a large amount\nof heating leads to a temperature at $\\sim 1000$ yr in excess of the Crab upper\nlimit. Suppression of accelerated neutrino emission processes, perhaps by\nsuperfluid pairing in the core, may yield acceptable cooling models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 1994 19:43:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 1995 17:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We study the g-mode\noscillations of cold neutron stars using recent microscopic nuclear equations\nof state, where we determine self-consistently the sound speed and\nBrunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency in the nuclear liquid core. The properties of the\ng-modes associated with the stable stratification of the core depend\nsensitively on the pressure-density relation as well as the symmetry energy of\nthe dense nuclear matter. The frequencies of the first ten g-modes lie\napproximately in the range of $10-100$ Hz. Resonant excitations of these\ng-modes during the last few minutes of the binary coalescence result in energy\ntransfer and angular momentum transfer from the binary orbit to the neutron\nstar. The angular momentum transfer is possible because a dynamical tidal lag\ndevelops even in the absence of fluid viscosity. However, since the coupling\nbetween the g-mode and the tidal potential is rather weak, the amount of energy\ntransfer during a resonance and the induced orbital phase error are very small.\nResonant excitations of the g-modes play an important role in tidal heating of\nbinary neutron stars. Without the resonances, viscous dissipation is effective\nonly when the stars are close to contact. The resonant oscillations result in\ndissipation at much larger orbital separation. The actual amount of tidal\nheating depends on the viscosity of the neutron star. Using the microscopic\nviscosity, we find that the binary neutron stars are heated to a temperature\n$\\sim 10^8$ K before they come into contact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 1994 01:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
