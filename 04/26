The phenomenon is usually referred to as\ndynamical friction. The velocity, $\\v$, of the test mass decays on a timescale\nindependent of $\\v$ in the non-relativistic case. We derive expressions for\ndynamical friction in the case that the test mass and the light particles are\nrelativistic, and that the scattering is weak (with impact parameter, $b\\gg\nM$). In the case that the light particles are ultra-relativistic, and isotropic\nin the frame in which $M$ moves with velocity $v$, we find an explicit\nexpression for the dynamical friction. The well known factor of 2 correcting\nthe Newtonian scattering of photons to give the Einstein angle, $4M/b$, has the\nlargest effect on the resulting friction, which is modified by a factor of\nroughly $16 / 3\\gamma_v$ over the simple non-relativistic case. In the\nnon-relativistic case, the largest contribution to the friction comes from\nlight particles moving slower than $v$. We find that this is not the case for\nultra-relativistic scattering, essentially because the scattering angle is\nindependent of $\\v$. Some astrophysical implications are discussed.
