This is an algebraic, but generally not rational, function\nof the coefficients. On the other hand, the global residue, which is the sum of\nthe local residues over all roots, depends rationally on the coefficients. This\npaper deals with symbolic algorithms for evaluating that rational function.\nUnder the assumption that the deformation to the initial forms is flat, for\nsome choice of weights on the variables, we express the global residue as a\nsingle residue integral with respect to the initial forms. When the input\nequations are a Groebner basis, this leads to an efficient series expansion\nalgorithm for global residues, and to a vanishing theorem with respect to the\ncorresponding cone in the Groebner fan. The global residue of a polynomial\nequals the highest coefficient of its (Groebner basis) normal form, and,\nconversely, the entire normal form is expressed in terms of global residues.\nThis yields a method for evaluating traces over zero-dimensional complete\nintersections. Applications include the counting of real roots, the computation\nof the degree of a polynomial map, and the evaluation of multivariate symmetric\nfunctions. All algorithms are illustrated for an explicit system in three\nvariables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 1994 11:17:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

In that paper, I found the lower bound to the Higgs\nmass as a function of the top quark mass one obtains by requiring that the\nstandard model vacuum be stable. It included all higher order corrections to\ntwo-loops, precise definitions of the Higgs and top masses, etc. Unfortunately,\nthe results were given for top quark masses between 120 and 160 GeV. In this\naddendum, I give the results for masses between 160 and 190 GeV. The main\nresult, using a value of 0.117 for the strong coupling at the Z-mass, is\nM_Higgs > 132 + 2.2 (M_top-170) in GeV units. This increases (decreases) by 4.5\nGeV if the strong coupling decreases (increases) by 0.007, and is accurate to 1\nGeV in the top mass. This will be submitted to Phys. Lett. as an addendum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 1994 14:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
