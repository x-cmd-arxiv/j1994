Its main advantage over BLR\ncloud models is the gravitational confinement of the gas and its major\ndifficulty the large estimated number of BSs and resulting high mass loss rate.\nWe calculate the emission line spectrum by a detailed numerical photoionization\ncode for a wide range of wind structures and a detailed QSO nucleus model with\nL(ion)=7E45 erg/s, M(bh)=8E7 Mo. The size and boundary density of the wind are\ndetermined by various processes: Comptonization by the central ionizing source\n(calculated self consistently), tidal disruption by the black hole and the\nlimit set by the wind's finite mass. We find that the emission spectrum is\nmainly determined by the conditions at the boundary of the line emitting\nfraction of the wind rather than by its internal structure. Comptonization\nresults in very high ionization parameters at the boundary which produces an\nexcess of unobserved broad high excitation forbidden lines. The finite mass\nconstraint limits the wind size, increases the boundary density and thus\nimproves the results. Slow decelerating mass-constrained flows with high gas\ndensities (1E8-1E12 cm^-3) are as success- ful as clouds in reproducing the\nobserved lines. Only 5E4 dense wind BSs are required in the inner 1/3 pc. This\nsmall fraction approaches that of super- giants (SG) in the solar neighborhood\nand the mass loss is consistent with the observational constraints. The BS\nnumber is a very sensitive function of the wind structure. SG-like BSs are\nruled out by their high mass loss. BSs with dense winds can reproduce the BLR\nline spectrum and be supported by the stellar population without excessive mass\nloss and collisional destruction rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 1994 12:03:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 1994 08:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

All\noff-diagonal (generation mixing) elements of Yukawa coupling matrices and of\nsquark/slepton mass matrices are included in solving numerically one-loop\nrenormalization group equations for MSSM parameters, and the parameter region\nconsistent with the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking condition is\nsearched. It is shown that the flavor mixing in the gluino coupling for a large\n$\\tan\\beta$ is of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding\nKobayashi-Maskawa matrix element in both up-type and down-type sector. There\nexist parameter regions where the nucleon decay amplitudes for charged lepton\nmodes are dominated by the gluino dressing process, while for all the examined\nregions the neutrino mode amplitudes are dominated by the wino dressing over\nthe gluino dressing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 1994 09:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}
