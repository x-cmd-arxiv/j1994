Thus\n$\\epsilon_c$ in low $\\beta$, moderate $M_f$ shocks tends to be smaller in quasi\nperpendicular shocks than it would be high $\\beta$ shocks of the same $M_f$.\nThis result supports earlier conclusions that strong, oblique magnetic fields\ninhibit diffusive shock acceleration. For quasi parallel shocks with $\\beta <\n1$, on the other hand, $\\epsilon_c$ seems to be increased at a given $M_f$ when\ncompared to high $\\beta$ shocks. The apparent contradiction to the first\nconclusion results, however, from the fact that for small $\\beta$ quasi\nparallel shocks, the fast mode Mach number is not a good measure of compression\nthrough the shock. That is better reflected in the sonic Mach number, which is\ngreater. Acceleration efficiencies for high and low $\\beta$ having comparable\nsonic Mach numbers are more similar. Time evolution of CR-MHD shocks is\nqualitatively similar to CR-gasdynamical shocks.
