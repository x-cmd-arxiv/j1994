The Gott spacetime\ncontains two infinitely long, parallel cosmic strings, which can equivalently\nbe viewed as point masses in (2+1)-dimensional gravity. We examine the\npossibility of building such a time machine in an open universe. Specifically,\nwe consider initial data specified on an edgeless, noncompact, spacelike\nhypersurface, for which the total momentum is timelike (i.e., not the momentum\nof a Gott spacetime). In contrast to the case of a closed universe (in which\nGott pairs, although not CTC's, can be produced from the decay of stationary\nparticles), we find that there is never enough energy for a Gott-like time\nmachine to evolve from the specified data; it is impossible to accelerate two\nparticles to sufficiently high velocity. Thus, the no-CTC theorems of Tipler\nand Hawking are enforced in an open (2+1)-dimensional universe by a mechanism\ndifferent from that which operates in a closed universe. In proving our result,\nwe develop a simple method to understand the inequalities that restrict the\nresult of combining momenta in (2+1)-dimensional gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 1994 20:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We\nfind that the evaporation process is in fact the shrinking of a throat that\nconnects a macroscopic interior ``universe\" to the asymptotically flat\nexterior. It ends either by pinching off the throat leaving a closed universe\nand a Minkowskian exterior or by freezing up when the throat's radius\napproaches a Planck size.
