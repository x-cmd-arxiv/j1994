In\ndimensions greater than 3, it has been pointed out by D. Burns that this result\nfollows from known results on biholomorphism groups of complex manifolds with\nboundary and the fact that any such CR manifold M can be realized as the\nboundary of an analytic variety. When M is 3-dimensional, Burns's proof breaks\ndown because abstract CR 3-manifolds are generically not realizable as\nboundaries. This paper provides an intrinsic proof of compactness that works in\nany dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 1994 20:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
