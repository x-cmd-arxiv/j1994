When plugged into the gauged WZNW\nmodel the given perturbation results in the perturbed gauged WZNW model which\nno longer describes a coset construction. We consider the BRST invariant\ngeneralization of the sigma model perturbation around the gauged WZNW model. In\nthis way we obtain perturbed coset constructions. In the case of the\n$SU_{m-2}(2)\\times SU_1(2)/SU_{m-1}(2)$ coset, the BRST invariant sigma model\nperturbation is identical to Zamolodchikov's $\\Phi_{(3,1)}$ perturbation of the\nminimal conformal series. The existence of general geometry flows is clarified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 1994 17:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 1994 18:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
