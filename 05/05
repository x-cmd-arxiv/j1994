The models are calculated using a new method for computing\nmonochromatic radiative transfer in two-dimensions. The method splits the\nradiation into direct and scattered components. The direct radiation is\ncomputed by calculating the optical depth along rays, while transfer of the\nscattered radiation is approximated by flux-limited diffusion. The resulting\ncode agrees with more accurate treatments to within 50\\%, and is highly\nefficient, making it practical for use in large hydrodynamic simulations. The\ncoronal models are used to confirm the results of earlier work, and to extend\nit to higher luminosities. In contrast to earlier work, which found the outer\ndisks to be shadowed by the inner corona at high luminosities, we find our\nresults to form an almost continuous extension of the models at lower\nluminosities. This is due to the presence of multiply-scattered radiation,\nwhich acts to partially offset the loss of direct radiation from the central\nsource. Although the analytic methods derived at lower luminosities cannot be\nused to derive the coronal structure for $L/L\\sr{Edd}\\gapprox0.1$, the results\nof the models are amenable to semiempirical fits. We also discuss possible\nobservational consequences of the results for coronal veiling and line\nfluorescence from the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 1994 15:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

In this report, we review\nthe theoretical formulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and discuss\nmany applications. Exactly solvable potentials can be understood in terms of a\nfew basic ideas which include supersymmetric partner potentials, shape\ninvariance and operator transformations. Familiar solvable potentials all have\nthe property of shape invariance. We describe new exactly solvable shape\ninvariant potentials which include the recently discovered self-similar\npotentials as a special case. The connection between inverse scattering,\nisospectral potentials and supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed and\nmulti-soliton solutions of the KdV equation are constructed. Approximation\nmethods are also discussed within the framework of supersymmetric quantum\nmechanics and in particular it is shown that a supersymmetry inspired WKB\napproximation is exact for a class of shape invariant potentials. Supersymmetry\nideas give particularly nice results for the tunneling rate in a double well\npotential and for improving large $N$ expansions. We also discuss the problem\nof a charged Dirac particle in an external magnetic field and other potentials\nin terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
