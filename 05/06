The dynamics of\nthe ellipsoid is set by the ellipsoid self-gravity and the external quadrupole\nshear. Both forces are linear in the coordinates and therefore maintain\nhomogeneity of the ellipsoid at all times. The amplitude of the external shear\nis evolved into the non-linear regime in thin spherical shells that are allowed\nto move only radially according to the mass interior to them. We describe how\nthe initial conditions can be drawn in the appropriate correlated way from a\nrandom field of initial density perturbations. By considering many random\nrealizations of the initial conditions, we calculate the distribution of shapes\nand angular momenta acquired by objects through the coupling of their\nquadrupole moment to the tidal shear. The average value of the spin parameter,\n0.04, is found to be only weakly dependent on the system mass, the mean\ncosmological density, or the initial power spectrum of perturbations, in\nagreement with N-body simulations. For the cold dark matter power spectrum,\nmost objects evolve from a quasi-spherical initial state to a pancake or\nfilament and then to complete virialization. Low-spin objects tend to be more\nspherical. The evolution history of shapes is primarily induced by the external\nshear and not by the initial triaxiality of the objects. The statistical\ndistribution of the triaxial shapes of collapsing regions can be used to test\ncosmological models against galaxy surveys on large scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 1994 19:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The existence of global\nparameter relations for elliptical galaxies and constraints on the evolution of\nthe phase space density in dissipationless mergers, allow us to limit the\npossible evolution of galaxy lens properties under merging.\n  We draw two lessons from implementing this lens evolution into statistical\nlens calculations: (1) The total optical depth to multiple imaging (e.g. of\nquasars) is quite insensitive to merging.

The associated\nHiggs field is a tetrad gravitational field $h$ represented by a global section\nof the quotient $\\Si$ of $LX$ by $SO(3,1)$. The feature of gravity as a Higgs\nfield issues from the fact that, in the presence of different tetrad fields,\nDirac fermion fields are described by spinor bundles associated with different\nreduced Lorentz subbundles of $LX$, and we have nonequivalent representations\nof cotangent vectors to $X^4$ by Dirac's matrices.

The observed correlations of the $\\pi^{\\pm} N \\to D^\\pm X$\ncross section with the projectile charge violates the usual assumption that\nheavy quark jet fragmentation factorizes. We examine the asymmetry between\nleading and nonleading charm production as a function of $x_f$ and $p_T^2$\nassuming a two-component model combining leading-twist fusion subprocesses and\ncharm production from intrinsic heavy quark Fock states. We predict a sizable\nasymmetry at low $p_T^2$ and high $x_f$ from coalescence of the charm quarks\nwith the comoving spectator quarks of the projectile. An intrinsic $c \\overline\nc$ production cross section of 0.5 $\\mu$b is sufficient to explain both the\nmagnitude and kinematic dependence of the asymmetry. In contrast, the charm jet\nhadronization mechanisms contained in PYTHIA predict a sizeable leading charm\nasymmetry even at low $x_F.$ The two-component model is extended to predict the\nasymmetry in $B$ meson production in proton-proton and pion-proton\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 1994 19:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
