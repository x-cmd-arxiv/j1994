We then n propose\nthis is the natural vacuum state of the theory for $\\Lambda \\neq 0$. 4)This\ntime coordinate is periodic on the configuration space of Euclideanized\nspacetimes, due to the large gauge transformations, which means that physical\nexpectation values for all states in non-perturbative quantum gravity will\nsatisfy the $KMS$ condition, and may then be interpreted as thermal states.\n5)Forms for the physical hamiltonians and inner product which support the\nproposal are suggested, and a new action principle for general relativity, as a\ngeodesic principle on the connection superspace, is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 1994 18:52:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 1994 19:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}
