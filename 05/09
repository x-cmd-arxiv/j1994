In particular it is an Omega_0 test,\npredicting current epoch galaxy velocities as a function of position and of the\ncosmological background. It is most usefully applied to in--falling structures,\nsuch as the local group, where its application indicates that the preferred\ncosmological model is Omega_0 = 0.1 and h=0.75 (h is the Hubble parameter in\nunits of 100 Km s^-1 Mpc^-1). The method assumes that all the mass acts as if\nit were distributed as the visible galaxies. We test the reliability of the LAP\nto Local Group-like systems extracted from Omega_0=1 N--body simulations. While\nthe orbits of the galaxies are qualitatively well reconstructed, the LAP\nsystematically underestimates the mass of the system. This failure is\nattributed to the presence of extended halos weakly clustered around visible\ngalaxies which prevent a large fraction of the group mass from being detected\nby the LAP technique. We conclude that the LAP method cannot rule out an\nOmega_0=1 value on the Local Group scale. Better constraints on Omega_0 may be\nobtained by applying this technique to in--falling systems, such as clusters,\ncontaining objects with separations large compared to galaxy sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 1994 12:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
