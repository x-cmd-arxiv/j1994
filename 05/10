The process begins with a maximum likelihood HMM that\ndirectly encodes the training data. Successively more general models are\nproduced by merging HMM states. A Bayesian posterior probability criterion is\nused to determine which states to merge and when to stop generalizing. The\nprocedure may be considered a heuristic search for the HMM structure with the\nhighest posterior probability. We discuss a variety of possible priors for\nHMMs, as well as a number of approximations which improve the computational\nefficiency of the algorithm.

Symmetric textures with two or three zeros can be generated\nthrough high-order operators containing light/heavy Higgs multiplets and\nsinglet fields. However, a realistic scenario for generating both the up- and\ndown-quark mass matrices is not possible within the MSSM with an extra singlet.\nThe presence of at least one pair of heavy Higgs multiplets and extra singlets\nare needed, and, even so, difficulties are encountered when extending this\nscenario to the neutrino sector through the mass relations of grand\nunification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 1994 22:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}
