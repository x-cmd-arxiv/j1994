First we show how one can find their probability\ndensities. For the case of the theory of wave turbulence with four-wave\ninteraction we calculate them explicitly and study their properties. Using\nthose densities we show how one can in principle calculate any correlation\nfunction in this theory by means of direct perturbative expansion in powers of\nthe interaction. Then we give the general form of the corrections to the\nkinetic equation and develop an appropriate diagrammatic technique. This\ntechnique, while resembling that of $\\varphi^4$ theory, has many new\ndistinctive features. The role of the $\\epsilon=d-4$ parameter is played here\nby the parameter $\\kappa=\\beta + d - \\alpha - \\gamma$ where $\\beta$ is the\ndimension of the interaction, $d$ is the space dimension, $\\alpha$ is the\ndimension of the energy spectrum and $\\gamma$ is the ``classical'' wave density\ndimension. If $\\kappa > 0$ then the Kolmogorov index is exact, and if $\\kappa <\n0$ then we expect it to be modified by the interaction. For $\\kappa$ a small\nnegative number, $\\alpha<1$ and a special form of the interaction we compute\nthis modification explicitly with the additional assumption of the irrelevance\nof the IR divergencies which still needs to be verified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 1994 22:25:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 1994 00:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
