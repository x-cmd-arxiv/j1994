Starting from an approximate\nequilibrium configuration at an initial proper time $\\tau$ in the disordered\nphase, we study the transition to the ordered broken symmetry phase as the\nsystem expands and cools. We give results for the proper time evolution of the\neffective pion mass, the order parameter $<\\sigma>$ as well as for the pion two\npoint correlation function expressed in terms of a time dependent phase space\nnumber density and pair correlation density. We investigate the possibility of\ndisoriented chiral condensate being formed during the expansion. In order to\ncreate large domains of disoriented chiral condensates low-momentum\ninstabilities have to last for long enough periods of time. Our simulations\nshow that instabilities that are formed during the initial stages of the\nexpansion survive for proper times that are at most $3\\,fm/c$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 1994 21:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
