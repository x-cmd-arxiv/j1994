These exchange\neffects are negligible for near-forward K+-deuteron scattering because of the\nlarge size of the deuteron, but at large angles they might be expected to be\nsignificant compared to the weak double scattering. Detailed calculations,\nhowever, show that the quadrupole and magnetic contributions from single\nscattering are large enough to dominate both double scattering and exchange\ncontributions even at large momentum transfers. The exchange contributions\nbecome significant only if the target deuteron is highly aligned so that the\nsingle scattering contributions are greatly reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 1994 18:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
