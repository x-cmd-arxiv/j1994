Variations of intermediate period elucidate the formation and evolution\nof chains of internal regularly spaced radiative shocks, which in this work are\nidentified with the observed emission knots of protostellar jets. Variations of\nlong period elucidate the formation of multiple bow shock structures separated\nby long trails of diffuse gas, which resemble those observed in systems like\nHH111 and HH46/47. The time variability of the outflow is probably associated\nwith observed irruptive events in the accretion process around the protostars.\nIn our simulations, the outflow variations are produced by periodically turning\non the outflow with a highly supersonic velocity and periodically turning off\nit to a low velocity regime. In the case of velocity variations of intermediate\nperiod, we find, as in previous work, that the shock structures form a train of\nregularly spaced emitting features which move away from the source with a\nvelocity close to that of the outflow, have high radial motions, and produce\nlow intensity spectra, as required by the observations. As they propagate\ndownstream, the shocks widen and dissipate due to the expulsion of material\nsideways to the cocoon by the high pressure gradients of the postshock gas.\nThis fading explains the most frequent occurence of knots closer to the driving\nsource. In the case of the long period velocity variability, our simulations\nhave produced a pair of bow-shock-like structures separated by a trail almost\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 1994 12:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
