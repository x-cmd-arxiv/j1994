W.r.t. the bosonic case the ordinary covariant derivative is now\nreplaced by a spinorial one containing a spin ${\\textstyle {1\\over 2}}$\nsuperfield. Each coset reduction is associated to a rational super-$\\cw$\nalgebra encoding a non-linear super-$\\cw_\\infty$ algebra structure. In the\n$N=2$ case two conjugate sets of superLax operators, equations of motion and\ninfinite hamiltonians in involution are derived. Modified hierarchies are\nobtained from the original ones via free-fields mappings (just as a m-NLS\nequation arises by representing the $sl(2)-{\\cal KM}$ algebra through the\nclassical Wakimoto free-fields).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 1994 19:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
