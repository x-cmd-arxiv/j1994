The properties of the merger-driven starbursts are\nsensitive to the structure of the progenitor galaxies; specifically, to the\namount of material in a dense central bulge. Galaxies without bulges develop\nbars shortly after their first close passage, driving significant gas inflow\nand subsequent starbursts in the centers of the galaxies. These starbursts\nsignificantly deplete the star-forming gas, so that only relatively weak\nstarbursts arise during the final merger. By contrast, models of galaxies with\ncentral bulges show that a bulge acts to stabilize the galaxies against inflow\nand starbursts until the galaxies actually merge. At this time, strong\ndissipation leads to the formation of a massive central gas mass and an ensuing\nstar formation rate two orders of magnitude greater than that in our isolated\ndisk models. These starbursts are very short in duration, typically $\\sim$ 50\nMyr, suggesting that the rarity of ultraluminous infrared galaxies is a result\nof their being in a very short evolutionary phase, rather than special and rare\nformation conditions. The fact that these mergers display many of the\nproperties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies -- tidal features, double nuclei,\nmassive compact gas concentrations, and extreme levels of starburst activity --\nsuggests that merger-driven starbursts can explain the emission from many\nultraluminous infrared galaxies without an active nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 1994 21:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
