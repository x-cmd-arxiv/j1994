It has been argued that such models\nmay require early reionization to suppress small-scale anisotropies in order to\nbe consistent with experimental data. We find that if the cosmological constant\nlambda=0, the extent of this suppression is quite insensitive to Omega_0. Given\na sigma_8-normalization today, the loss of small-scale power associated with a\nlower Omega_0 is partially canceled by higher optical depth from longer\nlookback times and by structures forming at higher redshifts before the\nuniverse becomes curvature-dominated. The maximum angular scale on which\nfluctuations are suppressed decreases when Omega_0 is lowered, but this effect\nis also rather weak and unlikely to be measurable in the near future. For flat\nmodels, on the other hand, where lambda_0 = 1-Omega_0, the negative effects of\nlowering Omega_0 dominate, and early reionization is not likely to play a\nsignificant role if Omega_0<<1.
