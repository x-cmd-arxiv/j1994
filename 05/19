We show\nhere that, in {\\it fivebrane} sigma-model metric, the extreme string solution\nof D=10 supergravity interpolates between Minkowski spacetime and a hitherto\nunknown supersymmetric $S^7$ compactification of d=10 supergravity to a\nthree-dimensional anti-de Sitter generalization of the linear dilaton vacuum,\nwhich may be invariantly characterized in terms of conformal\n  Killing vectors. The dilaton field diverges near the string core but this\ndivergence may be eliminated by re-interpreting the string solution as the\nextreme membrane solution of 11-dimensional supergravity. We show that the\nlatter has an analytic extension through a regular degenerate event horizon to\nan interior region containing a curvature singularity. We obtain analogous\nresults for other extended object solutions of supergravity theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 1994 10:40:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 May 1994 16:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-07"}
