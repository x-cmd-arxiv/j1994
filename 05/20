Approximately 70\\% (~3 x 10$^{23}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$)\nof the total radio power at 20 cm originates from the nuclear region ( <~ 1.5\nkpc), of which half is emitted by two unresolved ($R <~ 36 pc) cores and half\nby a diffuse component.

The\nsupernova rate required to power the diffuse component is consistent with that\npredicted by the stellar evolution models of Rieke \\etal (1985). If the radio\nemission from the two compact cores is powered by supernova remnants, then\neither the remnants overlap and form hot bubbles in the cores, or they are very\nyoung ( <~ 100 yr). Nearly all of the other 30\\% of the total radio power comes\nfrom an ``arm-like'' region extending westward from the nuclear region.
