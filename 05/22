After setting the problem in general we propose\na non-perturbative, self-consistent Hartree approximation. The method consists\nof evolving an initial functional thermal density matrix in time and is\nsuitable for studying phase transitions out of equilibrium. The renormalization\naspects are studied in detail and we find that the counterterms depend on the\ninitial state. We investigate the high temperature expansion and show that it\nbreaks down at long times. The infinite time limit is computed for de Sitter\nspacetime. We obtain the time evolution of the initial Boltzmann distribution\nfunctions, and argue that in the Hartree approximation, the time evolved state\nis a ``squeezed'' state. We illustrate the departure from thermal equilibrium\nby studying the case of a free field in de Sitter and radiation dominated\ncosmologies. It is found that a suitably defined non-equilibrium entropy per\nmode increases linearly with comoving time in a de Sitter cosmology, whereas it\nis {\\it not} a monotonically increasing function in the radiation dominated\ncase.
