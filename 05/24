We investigate mostly analytically the secular evolution of the\norbital parameters when the motion of $M_2$ is determined either by the mean\nfield generated by the uniform stellar distribution or by the gravitational\nfield of $M_1$.

We exhibit the resulting partial-wave S-matrix and the\nrich nucleon and Delta resonance spectrum of this simple model, comparing not\nonly to experiment but also to pion-nucleon scattering in the Skyrme model.
