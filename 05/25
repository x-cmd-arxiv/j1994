Phase transition of chiral symmetry breaking is described\nthrough explicit vacuum realignment. We find that for the present ansatz,\nvacuum structure of the light quark sector can be determined from $f_\\pi=92$\nMeV, which then yields that $\\Gamma(\\pi^0\\rightarrow 2 \\gamma)=8.3$ eV and,\n$R_{ch}=0.67$ fms, in agreement with experiments. This amounts to three\nindependent `observations' of the vacuum structure of the light quark sector.\nFor the calculation of $\\Gamma(\\pi^0\\rightarrow 2\\gamma)$, we do not use the\nanomaly equation - local gauge invariance for vacuum realignment becomes\nadequate. The above width is sensitive to the vacuum structure, and can give\nevidence regarding progress towards chiral symmetry restoration in QGP. The\ncorresponding results for $s$ quark sector are moderately good. We also exploit\nsimilar ideas for heavy quarks, but here the experimental data are rare, and\nthe theoretical techniques are likely to need refinements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 1994 14:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
