In the observationally interesting range, sources of same\ncompactness can be hotter if their spectrum is steeper. Instruments observing\nin the 50--500 keV energy range, such as OSSE on board CGRO, and especially the\nfuture SAX satellite, can be more successful in detecting sources moderately\nsteep, the flattest sources being characterized by an high energy cut--off at\ntoo low frequencies. For any given pair of values of spectral index and\ntemperature, Comptonization theory alone fixes the $ratio$ of the compactnesses\nin hard and soft photons. However, if the source is pair dominated, the\nabsolute values of the two compactnesses are fixed. Therefore there is a a\none--to--one correspondence between the physical parameters of the source (the\ncompactnesses in soft and hard photons) and the observable quantities (spectral\nindex and temperature). This correspondence can be extremely useful in\ninterpreting the physical behaviour of the sources, especially during\nvariations, and can help discriminating between different models for the high\nenergy emission of compact sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 1994 16:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

This model is defined assigning abelian variables\nto the plaquettes of an hypercubical lattice, and is dual to the four\ndimensional Ising model. This last model is known to present a second order\nphase transition with mean field critical exponents. We have performed Monte\nCarlo simulations on several lattice sizes and high statistics. The analysis of\nthe partition function zeroes and the specific heat scaling behaviour allowed\nus to estimate the critical coupling $\\beta_c$ as well as the critical\nexponents $\\nu$ and $\\alpha$. Our results are consistent with the second order\ncritical exponents $\\nu = 1/2$ and $\\alpha = 0$. The $\\beta_c$ value is in\nperfect agreement with duality predictions from the 4-d Ising model.\nNevertheless, the energy histograms show a seemingly non-vanishing double peak\nstructure. The interface tension analysis suggests that this may be a finite\nsize effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 1994 16:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
