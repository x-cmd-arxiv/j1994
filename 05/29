No less than 40\\% \\ of WR stars belong to binary systems. Young massive\nO and B stars are the secondary components of such systems. OB stars also have\nan intense stellar wind.\n  If the intensities of the stellar winds of WR and OB stars are more or less\ncomparable or if the distance between the components of the binary is large\nenough, the winds flowing out of WR and OB stars can collide and the shock\nwaves are formed. In the shock the gas is heated to temperature $\\sim 10^7$ K\nand generates X-ray emission.\n  Stellar wind collision may be responsible not only for the X-ray emission of\nWR + OB binaries and for their radio, IR and $\\gamma$-ray emision as well.\nStellar wind collision, gas heating, particle acceleration, and generation of\nX-ray, $\\gamma$-ray, radio and IR emission in WR + OB binaries are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 1994 06:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
