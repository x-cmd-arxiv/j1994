We find that the cluster metal deficiency\npreviously found from UBV photometry is too high; the cluster overall\nmetallicity, [Fe/H]=+0.24, is about 70% higher than the solar value. The\nchemical abundance pattern is unusual: the Ni/Fe ratio is significantly lower\nthan typical for field stars with similar Fe and Ca abundances, and the cluster\nmay also be deficient in the alpha element Si. For its age, the cluster is\nunusually far from the galactic disk, approximately 240 pc. The adopted\nheliocentric cluster radial velocity, +3.9 km/s, shows that it is close to its\nmaximum distance from the galactic plane. We suggest that the zeta Sculptoris\ncluster was formed in the galactic disk 45 Myr ago by the interaction of a high\nvelocity cloud with the interstellar medium, and that its formation may be\nconnected with that of Gould's Belt.

We have found that\ntypically in the beginning of this stage the classical inflaton field $\\phi$\nvery rapidly (explosively) decays into $\\phi$-particles or into other bosons\ndue to broad parametric resonance.

The last stages of\ndecay can be described in terms of perturbation theory. Complete reheating is\npossible only in those theories where a single massive $\\phi$-particle can\ndecay into other particles.
