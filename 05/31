Combined with the shifting-trick,\nthis gives explicit formulas for the multiplicities of the various irreducible\ncomponents. One of the assumptions of the Theorem is that the reduction is\nregular, so that the reduced space is a smooth symplectic manifold. In this\npaper, we prove a generalization of this result to the case where the reduced\nspace may have orbifold singularities. Our proof uses localization techniques\nfrom equivariant cohomology, and relies in particular on recent work of\nJeffrey-Kirwan and Guillemin.
