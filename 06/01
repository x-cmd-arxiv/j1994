A key element of this work is that we never appeal to any\nflavour symmetry. One main interesting feature emerges: only one of the light\nfermions, an up-type quark, to be identified with the top, can get a Yukawa\ncoupling at renormalizable level. This fact, together with bottom-tau Yukawa\nunification, also implied in our scheme, gives rise to a characteristic\ncorrelation between the top and the Higgs mass. By including a flavour-blind\ndiscrete symmetry and requiring that all higher dimensional operators be\nmediated by the exchange of appropriate heavy multiplets, it is possible to\ngive an approximate description of all masses and mixing angles in term of a\nhierarchy of grand unified scales. A special ``texture'' arises, implying a\nrelation between the top mass and the third generation mixing angles.
