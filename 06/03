The method is based on\nan expansion of the fields in orthogonal radial (Bessel) and angular (spherical\nharmonic) functions. In this coordinate system, peculiar velocities introduce a\ncoupling of the radial harmonics describing the density field in redshift space\nbut leave the angular modes unaffected. In the harmonic transform space, this\nradial coupling is described by a distortion matrix which can be computed\nanalytically within the context of linear theory; the redshift space harmonics\ncan then be converted to their real space values by inversion of this matrix.\nStatistical noise is mitigated by regularizing the matrix inversion with a\nWiener filter. The method yields a minimum variance estimate of the density\nfield in real space. In this coordinate system, the minimum variance harmonics\nof the peculiar velocity and potential fields are related to those of the\ndensity field by simple linear transformations. Tests of the method with\nsimulations of a CDM universe and comparison with previously proposed methods\ndemonstrate it to be a very promising new reconstruction method for the local\ndensity and velocity field.

The large $N$ limit of the nonlinear sigma\nmodel at the non-trivial fixed point is shown to be an example of a conformal\nfield theory, using zeta--function regularization. We compute the critical\nproperties of this model in various spaces of constant curvature ($R^2 \\times\nS^1$, $S^1\\times S^1 \\times R$, $S^2\\times R$, $H^2\\times R$, $S^1 \\times S^1\n\\times S^1$ and $S^2 \\times S^1$) and we argue that what distinguishes the\ndifferent cases is not the Riemann curvature but the conformal class of the\nmetric. In the case $H^2\\times R$ (constant negative curvature), the $O(N)$\nsymmetry is spontaneously broken at the critical point. In the case $S^2\\times\nR$ (constant positive curvature) we find that the free energy vanishes,\nconsistent with conformal equivalence of this manifold to $R^3$, although the\ncorrelation length is finite. In the zero curvature cases, the correlation\nlength is finite due to finite size effects. These results describe two\ndimensional quantum phase transitions or three dimensional classical ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 1994 00:30:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 1994 23:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
