These are shown to satisfy generalized `canonical\ncommutation relations', which we use to construct a basis of Hilbert space in\nterms of representations of the Yangian $Y(sl_2)$. Using this description, we\nexplicitly derive so-called `fermionic representations' of the Virasoro\ncharacters, which were first conjectured by Kedem et al.~\\cite{kedem}. We point\nout that similar results are expected for a wide class of rational conformal\nfield theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 1994 20:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
