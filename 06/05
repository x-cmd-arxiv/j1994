Galaxies hidden behind the ZOA may have important implications for\nthe internal dynamics of the Local Group, for the origin of its motion relative\nto the Microwave Background, and for the connectivity of the large scale\nstructure. Current direct (`observational') methods for exploring the ZOA\ninclude eye-balling of plates, source identification in the IRAS data base and\npointed and blind-search observations in 21 cm. Interesting regions identified\nso far include the two crossing points of the Supergalactic Plane by the\nGalactic Plane (at Galactic longitude $l \\sim 135^o$, near Perseus-Pisces, and\n$l \\sim 315^o$, near the Great Attractor), the Puppis cluster (at $l \\sim\n240^o, cz \\sim 1500$ km/sec) and the Ophiuchus cluster (at $l \\sim 0^o, cz \\sim\n8400$ km/sec). New promising wavelengths are the $2 \\mu$ and the X-ray band.\nIndirect (`theoretical') approaches include `Wiener reconstruction' from\nincomplete and noisy data, and using the peculiar velocity field as a probe of\nthe mass distribution hidden behind the ZOA. The problem of source confusion at\nlow Galactic latitude can be addressed by novel statistical methods, e.g.\nArtificial Neural Networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 1994 15:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The field equations imply strong restrictions on\nboundary values of all fields at the horizon. If the Yang-Mills radial electric\nfield $E$ is non-zero there, then all fields at the horizon take values in the\ncentralizer of $E$. For the particular case of SU(3), there are two different\nkinds of centralizers: two-dimensional abelian (Cartan subalgebra) and\nfour-dimensional (su(2)$\\times$u(1)) ones. The two-dimensional centralizer\nadmits only constant fields: even the geometry of the horizon is that of\nconstant curvature. If the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ is negative, a\ntwo-surface of any genus is possible; for positive curvature, only spherically\nsymmetrical horizons are allowed. For the four-dimensional centralizer, all\nspherically symmetrical horizons are explicitly given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 1994 21:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

The model thus provides a description of\nclassical and quantum dissipation in non homogeneous environments. In the\nclassical case we derive a generalized Langevin equation with nonlinear\nmultiplicative noise and a position-dependent fluctuation- dissipation theorem\nassociated to non homogeneous dissipative forces. When time-modulation of the\nnoise is present, a new force term is predicted besides the dissipative and\nrandom ones. The model is quantized to obtain the non homogenous influence\nfunctional and master equation for the reduced density matrix of the Brownian\nparticle. The quantum evolution equations reproduce the correct Langevin\ndynamics in the semiclassical limit. The consequences for the issues of\ndecoherence and localization are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 1994 19:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
