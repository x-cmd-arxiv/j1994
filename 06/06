The correction factor from observed to\nreconstructed harmonics turns out to be the well-known Wiener filter (the ratio\nof signal to signal+noise), which is also derived by requiring minimum\nvariance.

This brings a number of advantages over\nthe classical analysis. In particular, it enables the description of stronger\ndensity contrasts.
