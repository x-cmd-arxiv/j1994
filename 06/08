This approach is plagued by some problems:\nthe integration measure is not uniquely defined, the Einstein-Hilbert action\nunbounded, and perturbation theory nonrenormalizable. To make the path integral\ntractable one can approximate the continuous geometry of spacetime by a\nsimplicial complex. The edge lengths of this lattice are considered as the\ndynamical degrees of freedom and Regge calculus is applied. In this work,\nnumerical simulations using the Regge-Einstein action and a \"compact\" action\nshow the occurence of a phase transition. The strength of this transition,\nseparating a well-defined phase with finite expectation values from an\nill-defined phase, is weaker for the compact action, which might be important\nfor the continuum limit. To analyze the interaction mechanism of this\nformulation of quantum gravity, correlation functions between geometrical\nquantities like edge lengths, volume elements, and local curvatures have been\ncomputed. Our results for the two-point functions seem to prefer exchange\nparticles with an effective mass. To ease treatment of quantum gravity a new\napproach is proposed consisting in a transformation of the path integral to the\npartition function of a spin system. This facilitates analytical and numerical\ncalculations considerably. First results for the phase structure in two as in\nfour dimensions are presented and indicate promising similarities to the\noriginal Regge theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 1994 09:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 1994 12:33:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 1994 15:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

These methods are based on direct constructions of increasing\nsequences of partitions through a simple exhaustion procedure rather than on\nthe construction of well separated ultrametric subspaces. The first scheme of\nconstruction provides a simple unified proof of the Majorizing Measure Theorem\nfor Gaussian processes and of the following fact. If $A,B$ are balanced convex\nsets in a vector space, and if $A$ is sufficiently convex, a control of the\ncovering numbers $N(A,\\varepsilon B)$ for all $\\varepsilon>0$ implies the (a\npriori stronger) existence of a majorizing measure on $A$ provided with the\ndistance induced by $B$. This establishes, apparently for the first time, a\nclear link between geometry and majorizing measures, and generalizes the\nearlier results on majorizing measures on ellipsoids in Hilbert space, that\nwere obtained by specific methods. Much of the rest of the paper is concerned\nwith the structure of bounded Bernoulli (=Radmacher) processes. The main\nconjecture on their structure is reformulated in several ways, that are shown\nto be equivalent, and to be equivalent to the existence of certain majorizing\nmeasures. Two schemes of construction of majorizing measures related to this\nproblem are presented. One allows to describe Bernoulli processes when the\nindex set, provided with the supremum norm, is sufficiently small. The other\nallows to prove a weak form of the main conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 1994 18:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
