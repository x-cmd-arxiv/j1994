The problem is rigorously set up by considering the intrinsic\nLagrangian nature of the mass function. The Lagrangian equations of motion of a\ncold and irrotational fluid in single-stream regime show that the shear, which\nis non-locally determined by all the matter field, is the quantity which\ncharacterizes non-spherical perturbations. The Zel'dovich approximation, being\na self-consistent first-order Lagrangian and local one, is used as a suitable\nguide to develop realistic estimates of the collapse time of a mass clump,\nstarting from the local initial values of density and shear. Both\nZel'dovich-based \\an\\ and models and the homogeneous ellipsoidal model predict\nthat more large-mass objects are expected to form than the usual PS relation.\nIn particular, the homogeneous ellipsoid model is consistent at large masses\nwith a Press \\& Schechter mass function with a lower value of the \\dc\\\nparameter, in the range 1.4$\\div$1.6. This gives a dynamical explanation of why\nlower \\dc\\ values have been found to fit the results of several N-body\nsimulations. When more small-scale structure is present, highly non-linear\ndynamical effects can effectively slow down the collapse rate of a\nperturbation, increasing the effective value of \\dc. This may have interesting\nconsequences on the abundance of large-mass high-redshift objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 1994 17:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

For longer\ntimes the condition on the strength of the coupling to the external world\nbecomes much more stringent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 1994 21:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The charged axion-dilaton Taub-NUT\nsolutions are shown to have a number of interesting properties: i) manifest\n$SL(2,R)$ symmetry, ii) an infinite throat in an extremal limit, iii) the\nthroat limit coincides with an exact CFT construction.\n  The IWP solutions are shown to admit supersymmetric Killing spinors, when\nembedded in $d=4,N=4$ supergravity. This poses a problem for the interpretation\nof supersymmetric rotating solutions as physical ground states. In the context\nof $10$-dimensional geometry, we show that dimensionally lifted versions of the\nIWP solutions are dual to certain gravitational waves in string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 1994 01:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}
