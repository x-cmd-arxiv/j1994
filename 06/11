Both these quantities are generated\nself-consistently through an interlinked BSE-cum-SDE approach with a 3D support\nfor the BSE kernel with two basic constants which are pre- checked against a\nwide cross section of both meson and baryon spectra within a common structural\nframework for their respective 3D BSE's. With this pre-calibration, the\non-shell strength works out at -2.434$\\delta(m_q^2)$ in units of the change in\n\"constituent mass squared\", which is consistent with the $e^+e^-$ to\n$\\pi^+\\pi^-$ data for a u-d mass difference of ~4 MeV ,while the relative\noff-shell strength (0.99 $\\pm$ 0.01) lies midway between quark-loop and QCD-SR\nresults.
