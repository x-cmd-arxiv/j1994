The discrete symmetries of the problem are discussed in general. We\ncompute the exact two-point Green function for a free fermion, when a thin wall\nseparates the two phases. The Dirac propagator displays both massive and\nmassless poles, and new CP-even phases resulting from the fermion reflection on\nthe wall. We discuss the possible quark-antiquark CP asymmetries produced in\nthe Standard Model(SM) for the academic $T=0$ case. General arguments indicate\nthat an effect first appears at order $\\alpha_W$ in the reflection amplitude,\nas the wall acts as a source of momentum and the on-shell one-loop self-energy\ncannot be renormalized away. The asymmetries stem from the interference of the\nSM CP-odd couplings and the CP-even phases in the propagator.
