The technique employs a solver of the\nGodunov-type, with approximate solution of the local Riemann problems, applied\nto laboratory frame variables. Lorentz transformations provide the rest frame\nquantities needed for the estimation of wave speeds, etc. This is applied\nwithin the framework of an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm, allowing us to\nperform high-resolution, 2-D simulations with modest computing resources. We\npresent the results of nonrelativistic, and relativistic ($\\gamma=5$ and $10$)\nruns, for adiabatic indices of $5/3$ and $4/3$. We find the same gross\nmorphology in all cases, but the relativistic runs exhibit little instability\nand less well-defined structure internal to the jet: this might explain the\ndifference between (relatively slow) BL~Lacs and (faster) QSOs. We find that\nthe choice of adiabatic index makes a small but discernible difference to the\nstructure of the shocked jet and ambient media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 1994 20:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By using the algebraic formulation of quantum\ntheory, we propose a unifying perspective on these problems, based on the\nhypothesis that in a generally covariant quantum theory the physical time-flow\nis not a universal property of the mechanical theory, but rather it is\ndetermined by the thermodynamical state of the system (\"thermal time\nhypothesis\"). We implement this hypothesis by using a key structural property\nof von Neumann algebras: the Tomita-Takesaki theorem, which allows to derive a\ntime-flow, namely a one-parameter group of automorphisms of the observable\nalgebra, from a generic thermal physical state. We study this time-flow, its\nclassical limit, and we relate it to various characteristic theoretical facts,\nas the Unruh temperature and the Hawking radiation.
