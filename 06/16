The general approach is based on incremental\nimmediate flat analysis, learning of syntactic and semantic speech parsing,\nparallel integration of current hypotheses, and the consideration of various\nforms of speech related errors. The goal for this approach is to explore the\nparallel interactions between various knowledge sources for learning\nincremental fault-tolerant speech parsing. This approach is examined in a\nsystem SCREEN using various hybrid connectionist techniques. Hybrid\nconnectionist techniques are examined because of their promising properties of\ninherent fault tolerance, learning, gradedness and parallel constraint\nintegration.
