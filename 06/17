Since the knowledge\nof the weaknesses of any theory often makes improving the theory easier, the\ncentral idea of this thesis is to analyze the weaknesses of existing\nstatistical language models in order to subsequently improve them. To that end,\nwe formally define a weakness of a statistical language model in terms of the\nlogarithm of the total probability, LTP, a term closely related to the standard\nperplexity measure used to evaluate statistical language models. We apply our\ndefinition of a weakness to a frequently used statistical language model,\ncalled a bi-pos model. This results, for example, in a new modeling of unknown\nwords which improves the performance of the model by 14% to 21%. Moreover, one\nof the identified weaknesses has prompted the development of our generalized\nN-pos language model, which is also outlined in this thesis. It can incorporate\nlinguistic knowledge even if it extends over many words and this is not\nfeasible in a traditional N-pos model. This leads to a discussion of\nwhatknowledge should be added to statistical language models in general and we\ngive criteria for selecting potentially useful knowledge. These results show\nthe usefulness of both our definition of a weakness and of performing an\nanalysis of weaknesses of statistical language models in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 1994 12:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The assumption has sometimes been questioned, but the\nsuggestion has been thought outlandish, even by the taxed standards of the\ndiscipline. (Bell thought that it led to fatalism.) The case for this reaction\nturns out to be surprisingly weak, however. We show that QM easily evades the\nstandard objections to advanced action. And the approach has striking\nadvantages, especially in avoiding the apparent conflict between Bell's Theorem\nand special relativity.\n  The second part of the paper considers the broader question as to why\nadvanced action seems so counterintuitive. We investigate the origins of our\nordinary intuitions about causal asymmetry. It is argued that the view that the\npast does not depend on the future is largely anthropocentric, a kind of\nprojection of our own temporal asymmetry. Many physicists have also reached\nthis conclusion, but have thought that if causation has no objective direction,\nthere is no objective content to an advanced action interpretation of QM. This\nturns out to be a mistake. From the ordinary subjective perspective, we can\ndistinguish two sorts of objective world: one \"looks as if\" it contains only\nforward causation, the other ``looks as if'' it involves a mix of backward and\nforward causation. This clarifies the objective core of an advanced action\ninterpretation of QM, and shows that there is an independent symmetry argument\nin favour of the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 1994 02:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-23"}
