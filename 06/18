The density of the circumstellar gas can be deduced\nfrom the free-free absorption of the radio emission and from the X-ray\nluminosity. During the first two weeks, both sets of observations indicate a\nmass loss rate of $\\sim 4\\EE{-5} \\Msun ~\\rm yr^{-1}$ for a wind velocity of $10\n\\kms$. The subsequent radio and X-ray observations indicate a density gradient\n$\\propto r^{-s}$, with $1.5 \\lsim s \\lsim 1.7$, as opposed to the $r^{-2}$\ngradient expected for a steady, spherically symmetric wind. This may either be\ncaused by a variation of the mass loss rate from the progenitor system, or by a\nnon-spherically symmetric geometry. To explain the properties of the X-ray\nemission, a steep density gradient in the ejecta is needed. During the first\nmonths most of the observed X-ray emission originates from the circumstellar\nshock, which is adiabatic, while the reverse shock is radiative. To avoid\nexcessive Comptonization in the X-ray range collisionless heating must be\nineffective. The soft X-rays observed at 220 days probably originate from the\nreverse shock. The ionization and temperature structures of the circumstellar\ngas are calculated; we find that the temperature is in excess of $10^5 \\rm~K$\nand the medium is nearly completely ionized by the shock radiation after the\nformation of the shocks. Preacceleration of the circumstellar gas by the\nradiation from the outbreak can explain\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 1994 08:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
