The action for two-dimensional gravity is choosen in a well-known\ninduced form and thus gravity posesses it's oun nontrivial dynamics even on the\nclassical level. Three classically equivalent forms of the action of the\nunified theory are described, that is $D$, $D+1$ and $D+2$ formulations where\nthe last one corresponds to the special kind of nonlinear sigma model on the\nbackground of classical two-dimensional metric. In all cases we find the action\nof the theory to be invariant under generalized symmetry transformations, and\npoint out the arbitrariness of renormalization which reflects this symmetry.\nThe one - loop counterterms are calculated in a general covariant gauge and\nalso in conformal gauge. The difference between the counterterms for all\nclassically equivalent variants of the theory is trivial on mass-shell. Since\nthe different versions of the theory lead to the one-loop contributions which\ncoincide on mass shell, the corresponding arbitrariness is related with the\nonly generalized reparametrizations of the theory. Hence one can formulate the\nconditions of Weyl symmetry for any equivalent form of the action. Such a\nconditions are written for the $D+2$ formulation and then are reduced to other\nones. The equations for the background interaction fields differ from the ones\nin standard approach and look much more complicated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 1994 12:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
