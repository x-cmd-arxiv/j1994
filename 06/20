These theories arise naturally as the\nlow-energy limit of four-dimensional toroidal compactifications of the\nheterotic string. Firstly, we define the free energy in the presence of\nelectric and magnetic fluxes using 't Hooft's prescription, i.e. through\nfunctional integrals at finite volume in the presence of twisted boundary\nconditions. Then, we compute those free energies in two limiting cases: small\nand large coupling constant. Finally, we extend the free-energies to all values\nof the coupling constant (and the theta angle) by presenting a fully S-duality\ninvariant ansatz. This ansatz obeys all relevant consistency conditions; in\nparticular, it obeys 't Hooft duality equations and Witten's magnetic-electric\ntransmutation. The existence of an S-duality invariant, consistent definition\nof free energies supports the claim made in the literature that S-duality is a\nduality symmetry of N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills. Our ansatz also suggests that N=4,\nirrespective of whether partially broken or not, is in a self-dual phase: no\nphase transitions occur between the strong and weak coupling regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 1994 17:03:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 1994 19:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}
