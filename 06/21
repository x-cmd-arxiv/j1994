Their existence provides an opportunity to investigate the human\nsentence processing mechanism by studying how and when it fails. The aim of\nthis thesis is to construct a computational model of language understanding\nwhich can predict processing difficulty. The data to be modeled are known\nexamples of garden path and non-garden path sentences, and other results from\npsycholinguistics.\n  It is widely believed that there are two distinct loci of computation in\nsentence processing: syntactic parsing and semantic interpretation. One\nlongstanding controversy is which of these two modules bears responsibility for\nthe immediate resolution of ambiguity. My claim is that it is the latter, and\nthat the syntactic processing module is a very simple device which blindly and\nfaithfully constructs all possible analyses for the sentence up to the current\npoint of processing. The interpretive module serves as a filter, occasionally\ndiscarding certain of these analyses which it deems less appropriate for the\nongoing discourse than their competitors.\n  This document is divided into three parts. The first is introductory, and\nreviews a selection of proposals from the sentence processing literature. The\nsecond part explores a body of data which has been adduced in support of a\ntheory of structural preferences --- one that is inconsistent with the present\nclaim.

It is found that, for A_t<0 and the top quark mass within the\nvicinity of the center of the CDF value, m_t^{pole}=174\\pm17 GeV, there exists\nonly a small allowed domain because the light stop is tachyonic for most of the\nparameter space. A similar phenomenon exists for a lighter top and A_t negative\nwhen the GUT coupling constant is slightly reduced. For A_t>0, however, the\nbranching ratio is much less sensitive to small changes in m_t, and \\alpha_G.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 1994 02:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
