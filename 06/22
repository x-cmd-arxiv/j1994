For example, a power-law distribution (of two parameters $A$\nand $\\gaml$) is $F(z;A,\\gaml) = A z^{-\\gaml}$. I present the MVB in a form\nwhich is suitable for estimating uncertainties in problems of astrophysical\ninterest. For many distributions, such as a power-law distribution or an\nexponential distribution in the presence of a constant background, the MVB can\nbe evaluated in closed form. I give analytic estimates for the variances in\nseveral astrophysical problems including the gallium solar-neutrino experiments\nand the measurement of the polarization induced by a weak gravitational lens. I\nshow that it is possible to make significant improvements in the accuracy of\nthese experiments by making simple adjustments in how they are carried out or\nanalyzed. The actual variance may be above the MVB because of the form of the\ndistribution function and/or the number of observations. I present simple\nmethods for recognizing when this occurs and for obtaining a more accurate\nestimate of the variance than the MVB when it does.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 1994 21:23:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
