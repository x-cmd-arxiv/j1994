One way to circumvent this problem is to formulate the theory\nsuch that this U(1) symmetry is explicitly broken. However we argue that in the\nframework of spectral flow, fermion creation and annihilation still in fact\noccurs, despite the exact fermion number conservation. The crucial observation\nis that fermions are excitations relative to the vacuum, at the surface of the\nDirac sea. The exact global U(1) symmetry prohibits a state from changing its\nfermion number during time evolution, however nothing prevents the fermionic\nground state from doing so.

The\ndifference in fermion number between the time evolved state and the ground\nstate is indeed in agreement with the anomaly.

Solving a\nrate equation for the baryon number generation, we obtain an expression for the\nfinal baryon asymmetry of the Universe containing the relevant parameters of\nthe bubble wall, {\\it i.e.} its velocity, its width, and the width of the\nregion in which sphalerons are active. Compared to previous estimates in which\ntransport effects were not taken into account, we find an enhancement of nearly\nthree orders of magnitude in the baryon asymmetry. Finally, the role of QCD\nsphalerons in cooperation with transport effects is analyzed, showing that the\nnet result depends crucially on the particle species which enter into the\ncharge potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 1994 16:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

Moody and Victor\nG. Kac in 1968. Inspired by mathematical structures found by theoretical\nphysicists, and by the desire to understand the ``monstrous moonshine'' of the\nMonster group, the theory of vertex operator algebras (VOA's) was introduced by\nBorcherds, Frenkel, Lepowsky and Meurman. An important subject in this young\nfield is the study of modules for VOA's and intertwining operators between\nmodules. Feingold, Frenkel and Ries defined a structure, called a vertex\noperator para-algebra(VOPA), where a VOA, its modules and their intertwining\noperators are unified. In this work, for each $l\\geq 1$, we begin with the\nbosonic construction (from a Weyl algebra) of four level $-\\shf$ irreducible\nrepresentations of the symplectic affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra $C_l^{(1)}$. The\ndirect sum of two of these is given the structure of a VOA, and the direct sum\nof the other two is given the structure of a twisted VOA-module. In order to\ndefine intertwining operators so that the whole structure forms a VOPA, it is\nnecessary to separate the four irreducible modules, taking one As the VOA and\nthe others as modules for it. This work includes the bosonic analog of the\nfermionic construction of a vertex operator superalgebra from the four level 1\nirreducible modules of type $D_l^{(1)}$ given by Feingold, Frenkel and Ries.\nWhile they only get a VOPA when $l = 4$ using classical triality, the\ntechniques in this work apply to any $l\\geq 1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 1994 16:56:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 1994 19:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

Here we study a Skyrme model\nwhere physical space is two-dimensional euclidean space and the target space is\nthe two-sphere with its standard metric. The model has topological soliton\nsolutions which are exponentially localised. We describe a superposition\nprocedure for solitons in our model and derive an expression for the\ninteraction potential of two solitons which only involves the solitons'\nasymptotic fields. If the solitons have topological degree 1 or 2 there are\nsimple formulae for their interaction potentials which we use to prove the\nexistence of solitons of higher degree. We explicitly compute the fields and\nenergy distributions for solitons of degrees between one and six and discuss\ntheir geometrical shapes and binding energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 1994 13:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Instead\nof reducing the dynamics to one particle potential scattering, the scattering\namplitude for fixed target configurations is averaged over the target\ngroundstate density via stochastic integration. At low energies a strong\ncoupling limit is found which can not be obtained in a first order optical\npotential approximation. As its physical explanation, we propose it to be\ncaused by trapping of the projectile. We analyse this phenomenon in mean field\nand random potential approximations.\n  (PACS: 24.10.-i)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 1994 13:07:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 1994 09:57:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 1994 13:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
