Relevant aspects of the Hamiltonian path integral and its\nmeasure are discussed and used to show that the quantum mechanical version of\nthe classical transformation does not leave the measure of the path integral\ninvariant, instead inducing an anomaly. The relation to operator techniques and\nordering problems is discussed, and special attention is paid to incorporation\nof the initial and final states of the transition element into the boundary\nconditions of the problem. Classical canonical transformations are developed to\nrender an arbitrary power potential cyclic. The resulting Hamiltonian is\nanalyzed as a quantum system to show its relation to known quantum mechanical\nresults. A perturbative argument is used to suppress ordering related terms in\nthe transformed Hamiltonian in the event that the classical canonical\ntransformation leads to a nonquadratic cyclic Hamiltonian. The associated\nanomalies are analyzed to yield general methods to evaluate the path integral's\nprefactor for such systems. The methods are applied to several systems,\nincluding linear and quadratic potentials, the velocity-dependent potential,\nand the time-dependent harmonic oscillator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 1994 15:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
