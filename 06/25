Using simple analytical arguments and checking with numerical\ncomputations, we show that objects are destroyed by the tidal field of the\nglobal cluster potential if their mean density is small compared to the mean\ncluster density within the radius of closest approach of the group or detached\ncore. Accreted groups and small clusters are thus tidally disrupted in one\ncluster crossing. Since the cores of clusters are much denser than groups, they\nare considerably more robust to tides, but the least massive are destroyed or\nseverely stripped by tides, while the others are brought to the cluster center\nby dynamical friction (and subsequently merge) in less than one orbit. The\nlongest lived substructures are detached cores, roughly ten times less massive\nthan the cluster, starting in near-circular orbits beyond $1 \\, h^{-1} \\, \\rm\nMpc$ from the cluster center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 1994 17:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
