For Hamiltonian systems the\nexponents are related to the eigenvalues of a symplectic matrix. We make use of\nthis fact to develop a new method for the calculation of Lyapunov exponents of\nsuch systems. Our approach avoids the renormalization and reorthogonalization\nof usual techniques. It is also easily extendible to damped systems. We apply\nour method to two examples of physical interest: a model system that describes\nthe beam halo in charged particle beams and the driven van der Pol oscillator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 1994 01:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The\ndata indicates that shadowing or leading twist modifications of parton\ndistributions can be ruled out as explanations, leaving higher twist energy\nloss. {}From general principles the maximum allowed energy loss of partons\ntraversing the nuclear medium can be related to the parton transverse momenta.\nWe then show that the experimental data on nuclear suppression of charm- and\nbottom- onium for large $x_F$ is consistent with this effect: using the\nobserved transverse momenta to bound the $x_F$ dependence in an almost model\nindependent manner generates a relation that practically reproduces the data.\nSeveral prediction are discussed; the dependence on $x_F$ as $x_F\\to 1$, and\nlarge and small $k_T^2$ cuts, can be used to discriminate between quark and\ngluon induced effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 1994 16:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
