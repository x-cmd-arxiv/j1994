While the level-one\nroot spaces can be completely characterized in terms of transversal DDF states\n(the level-zero elements just span the affine subalgebra), longitudinal DDF\nstates are shown to appear beyond level one. In contrast to previous treatments\nof such algebras, we find it necessary to make use of a rational extension of\nthe self-dual root lattice as an auxiliary device, and to admit non-summable\noperators (in the sense of the vertex algebra formalism). We demonstrate the\nutility of the method by completely analyzing a non-trivial level-two root\nspace, obtaining an explicit and comparatively simple representation for it. We\nalso emphasize the occurrence of several Virasoro algebras, whose interrelation\nis expected to be crucial for a better understanding of the complete structure\nof the Kac Moody algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 1994 12:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}
