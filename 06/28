In chapter I we construct an effective lagrangian of QCD with the low\nmass mesons ($\\pi,\\rho,A_1$ and the scalar meson $\\epsilon$) generalising the\nSkyrme model. The vector meson fields are introduced as massive gauge fields in\nthe linear sigma model and we look for topological soliton solutions of the\nmodel. The results for the nucleon-nucleon interaction show that the scalar\ndegrees of freedom give rise to attractive intermediate range forces. This is\nin sharp contrast to models incorporating vector degrees of freedom where only\nrepulsive forces are found. In chapter II we evaluate the leading correction to\nthe classical Skyrmion mass. The main ultraviolet divergence is cancelled by\nwell known chiral counterterms. The low energy behaviour of the phase shifts\nwhich are large and positive dominates the result. As a consequence, the\ncorrection is found to be negative and rather large, of the order of 1 GeV for\nthe original Skyrme model. We then show that the situation improves if one\nintroduces higher chiral orders in the effective lagrangian.
