Yet any\ngiven model can always be saved by introducing and tuning extraneous free\nparameters. To better understand this question of ``nature versus nurture'' for\ntemperature fluctuations, it is useful to know not only the general features of\nanisotropy predictions but also their causes. Extracting the physical content\nof our other works, we present here a {\\it simple} account of cosmic microwave\nbackground anisotropies on all scales. In particular, we show that analytic\napproximations can trace the structure of the so-called ``Doppler peaks,''\nwhich arise due to the {\\it adiabatic} oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid.\nWe also show how the finite thickness of the last scattering surface and the\nSilk damping mechanism can be described in a unified way by photon diffusion.\nIn order to present a specific example, we focus on comparing the primordial\nisocurvature baryon (PIB) model with the standard cold dark matter model (CDM).\nIn particular, we explain why PIB generically predicts larger {\\it\nnon}-oscillatory anisotropies from the 1$^\\circ$ to 10$^\\circ$ scale which may\nalready be in conflict with experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 1994 19:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
