The scenarios\nstudied here are ones in which an initial spacelike surface is joined by a\nconnected ``interpolating spacetime'' to a final spacelike surface, possibly of\ndifferent topology. The interpolating spacetime is required to obey a condition\ncalled causal compactness, a condition satisfied in a very wide range of\nsituations. No assumption is made about the dimension of spacetime. First, it\nis stressed that topology change is kinematically possible; i.e., if a field\nequation is not imposed, it is possible to construct topology-changing\nspacetimes with non-singular Lorentz metrics. Simple 2-dimensional examples of\nthis are shown. Next, it is shown that there are problems in such spacetimes:\nGeroch's closed-universe argument is applied to causally compact spacetimes to\nshow that even in this wider class of spacetimes there are causality violations\nassociated with topology change. It follows from this result that there will be\ncausality violations if the initial (or the final) surface is not connected,\neven when there is no topology change. Further, it is shown that in dimensions\n$\\geq 3$ causally compact topology-changing spacetimes cannot satisfy\nEinstein's equation (with a reasonable source); i.e., there are severe\ndynamical obstructions to topology change. This result extends a previous one\ndue to Tipler. Like Tipler's result, it makes no assumptions about geodesic\ncompleteness; i.e., it does not permit topology change even at the price of\nsingularities (of the standard incomplete-geodesic variety).

Thus the\nstring/fivebrane duality conjecture in $D=10$ gets replaced by a string/string\nduality conjecture in $D=6$. Since $D=6$ strings are better understood than\n$D=10$ fivebranes, this provides a more reliable laboratory in which to test\nthe conjecture. According to string/string duality, the Green--Schwarz\nfactorization of the $D=6$ spacetime anomaly polynomial $I_{8}$ into $X_4\\,\n\\tilde{X}_4$ means that just as $X_4$ is the $\\sigma$-model anomaly polynomial\nof the fundamental string worldsheet so $\\tilde{X}_4$ should be the\ncorresponding polynomial of the dual string worldsheet.
