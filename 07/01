We analyze the screening effects\non the attractive part of the potential in the intermediate range as density or\ntemperature increase. In the long range the potential shows Friedel-like\noscillations instead of the usual exponential damping. These oscillations arise\nfrom the sharp edge of the Fermi surface and should be encountered in any\nrealistic model of nuclear matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 1994 10:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}
