Previous Einstein observations had revealed that this\ngalaxy has a low X-ray to optical ratio Lx/Lb. Theoretical models of the X-ra\nemission of early-type galaxies had suggested that in objects of this kind the\nemission is not dominated by the presence of a hot diffuse gas, but should\noriginate in stellar sources. We discuss the evidence in favor of this\nhypothesis following from the results of the analysis of the ROSAT PSPC data.\nThe X-ray spectrum shows properties similar to those of the other two low Lx/Lb\nearly-type galaxies observed by ROSAT so far, including the presence of very\nsoft emission. So, these galaxies can be recognized as a group with homogeneous\nproperties, and a more exhaustive picture of the nature of the X-ray emission\nacross the Lx/Lb plane of early-type galaxies can be outlined. We also discuss\nthe importance of rotation in the X-ray emission of S0 galaxies, and suggest\nthat it could explain why on average S0s are less X-ray luminous than\nellipticals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 1994 15:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

In the framework of\nthe MSSM, with universal soft supersymmetry breaking parameters at the grand\nunification scale, large values of the universal gaugino mass $M_{1/2}\\geq 300$\nGeV are needed in order to induce a proper breakdown of the electroweak\nsymmetry.

The model is strongly\nconstrained by theoretical and phenomenological requirements and a heavy top\nquark, with mass $M_t\\geq 170$ GeV, is hard to accomodate within this scheme.\nHowever, we show that to accommodate a top quark mass $M_t\\simeq180$ GeV, it is\nsufficient to relax the condition of universality of the scalar soft SUSY\nbreaking parameters at the grand unification scale.
