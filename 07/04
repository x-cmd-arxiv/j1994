Ca. $90$ bits of\ninformation contained in the system of representations in the Standard Model\nare explained by four reasonable postulates. A crude estimate is that there is\nof the order of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^2$ useful bits of unexplained information\nleft today. There are several signs of the fact that the Standard Model is a\nlow energy tail of a more fundamental theory (not yet known). However, some\nworries are expressed as concerns how far the exploration of the physics beyond\nthe Standard Model can proceed - if we are to be inspired from these $\\sim 2\n\\times 10^2$ bits alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 1994 19:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
