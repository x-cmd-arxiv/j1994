The hadronic and quark matter\nequations of state are calculated by using nonlinear Walecka model and chiral\ncolour dielectric (CCD) model respectively. We find that the phase transition\nfrom hadron to quark matter is possible in a narrow range of the parameters of\nnonlinear Walecka and CCD models. The transition is strong or weak first order\ndepending on the parameters used. The EOS thus obtained, is used to study the\nproperties of hybrid stars. We find that the calculated hybrid star properties\nare similar to those of pure neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 1994 23:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
