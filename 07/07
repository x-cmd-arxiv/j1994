The theory localizes onto reducible connections and a\ncareful evaluation of the fixed point contributions leads to an alternative\nderivation of the Verlinde formula for the $G_{k}$ WZW model. We show that the\nsupersymmetry of the $G/G$ model can be regarded as an infinite dimensional\nrealization of Bismut's theory of equivariant Bott-Chern currents on K\\\"ahler\nmanifolds, thus providing a convenient cohomological setting for understanding\nthe Verlinde formula. We also show that the supersymmetry is related to a\nnon-linear generalization (q-deformation) of the ordinary moment map of\nsymplectic geometry in which a representation of the Lie algebra of a group $G$\nis replaced by a representation of its group algebra with commutator $[g,h] =\ngh-hg$.
