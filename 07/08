We use the luminosity\nfunction of globular clusters as a function of galactocentric distance to\nprovide a very strong constraint on the properties of RAMBOs. We show that at\nthe solar radius, dynamical constraints confine such clusters to a bounded and\nnarrow parameter space with effective radii between 1 pc and 15 pc,\ncorresponding to masses between $ \\sim 10 -10^4 M_\\odot$ and $\\sim\n10^4-10^6M_\\odot$, respectively. Compact and massive clusters are excluded by\nthese constraints, and therefore cannot provide a heating source capable of\nexplaining the observed correlation between age and velocity dispersion for\ndisk stars. Less than 1\\% of the halo could be within RAMBOs of mass\n$10^7M_\\odot$;an order magnitude lower than required in the model proposed by\nWasserman \\& Salpeter. Neither the IRAS or ISO infrared satellites have the\ncapability to detect clusters of brown dwarfs within the dynamically allowed\nparameter space. Clusters of white dwarfs that formed a Hubble time ago have a\nsurface brightness several magnitudes below the sky level; even clusters of low\nmass stars at the edge of the main sequence would remain invisible to the\ndeepest K band surveys to date. We conclude that gravitational microlensing is\nthe only method capable of constraining the abundance of dark matter in the\nform of clusters of stars. Recovering the dynamical properties of RAMBOs will\nbe very difficult due to their large covering factor and low internal velocity\ndispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 1994 16:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
