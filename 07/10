Using the Luttinger liquid theory, we obtained phase diagrams of the\nground state on $U_d-U_{pd}$ plane, where $U_d$ and $U_{pd}$ represent on-site\ninteraction at d-sites and the nearest-neighbor interaction between p- and\nd-sites respectively. In the weak coupling region, they agree with the g-ology;\na superconducting phase (SC(I)) is restricted to attractive interaction\n$U_{pd}<0$. On the other hand, in the strong coupling region, we found a novel\nsuperconducting phase(SC(II)) for repulsive interaction $U_{pd}>|U_d|$ and a\ninsulating state with a charge gap for $U_d>U_d^c$ and $U_{pd}>U_{pd}^c$ with\ncritical values $U_d^c$ and $U_{pd}^c$ at half-filling.\n  Away from half-filling, another superconducting phase (SC(III)) appears for\n$U_d>>U_{pd}>0$; which has been found for $U_d\\to \\infty$ in the previous paper\n[Physica {\\bf C205} (1993) 170]. An analysis of the spin gap suggests that the\nSC(I) and SC(II) include the Luther-Emery region (with spin-gap) in part, while\nthe SC(III) belongs to Tomonaga-Luttinger region (without spin-gap) in whole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 1994 10:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}
