The arrays are modeled by the resistively\nshunted Josephson junction model, appropriate for proximity effect junctions,\nincluding self-induced magnetic fields as well as disorder. The relevance of\nthe self-induced fields is measured as a function of a parameter\n$\\kappa=\\lambda_L/a$, with $\\lambda_L$ the London penetration depth of the\narrays, and $a$ the lattice spacing. The transition from Type II ($\\kappa>1$)\nto Type I ($\\kappa <1$) behavior is studied in detail. We compare the results\nfor models with self, self+nearest-neighbor, and full inductance matrices. In\nthe $\\kappa=\\infty$ limit, we find that when the initial state has at least one\nvortex-antivortex pair, after a characteristic transient time these vortices\nunbind and {\\it radiate} other vortices. These radiated vortices settle into a\nparity-broken, time-periodic, {\\em axisymmetric coherent vortex state} (ACVS),\ncharacterized by alternate rows of positive and negative vortices lying along a\ntilted axis. The ACVS produces subharmonic steps in the current voltage (IV)\ncharacteristics, typical of giant Shapiro steps. For finite $\\kappa$ we find\nthat the IV's show subharmonic giant Shapiro steps, even at zero external\nmagnetic field. We find that these subharmonic steps are produced by a whole\nfamily of coherent vortex oscillating patterns, with their structure changing\nas a function of $\\kappa$. In general, we find that these patterns are due to a\nbreak down of translational invariance produced, for example, by disorder or\nantisymmetric edge-fields.
