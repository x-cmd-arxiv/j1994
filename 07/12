A review of all known\nyoung pulsars shows that the majority are associated with supernova remnants.\nWe show that the typical density of the interstellar medium into which the\nsupernova remnants are evolving has a density of 0.2 cm$^{-3}$ instead of the\nlow value of 0.01 cm$^{-3}$ which had been calculated from other studies, and\nresults in a considerably longer radio lifetime for supernova remnants. Both\nthe morphology of the supernova remnants and the location of the pulsars imply\nthat most of these young pulsars are born with large transverse velocities\n($\\sim$500 km s$^{-1}$).

We explore the\nimplications of this result as it relates to the origin of these velocities and\nthe galactic distribution of pulsars. High velocity pulsars can escape their\nsupernova remnant in a very short timescale, comparable to the lifetime of the\nremnant and may even play a role in extending the observable radio lifetime of\nthe remnant.
