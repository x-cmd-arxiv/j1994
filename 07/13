Such an example\nis the four SU(2) factors obtained through the reduction of the subgroup\n$SU(2)\\otimes SO(7)$ of SO(10) with the SO(7) to the three SU(2) factors. The\nbranching rule in this case is given by $(f.s)\\rightarrow (2-1-2-2)\\oplus\n(2-2-1-2)$ in terms of dimensions. A consistent gauge theory implies the gauge\nsymmetry in a gauge subgroup, and then needs to be well-defined when\nrestricting to the gauge subgroup. Consequently, a consistent SO(10) quantum\ntheory needs to satisfy our selection rule $N_f+N_{mf}=even\\geq 4$, namely the\ntotal number of generations with $N_f$ ordinary fermion families and $N_{mf}$\nmirror fermion families is even and larger than three, and the three\ngenerations of chiral fermions in this content can not correspond to a\nconsistent theory. Then we expect that there exist at least one additional\nfermion family including a right-handed neutrino or at least one family of\nmirror fermions including a left-handed mirror neutrino if SO(10) unification\ntheory is relevant to our realistic world. The next possibility is to have\ntotal six generations that may subject to stringent\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 1994 03:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 1994 00:54:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 1994 04:25:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 1994 21:09:33 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 1994 00:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
