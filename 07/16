The K\\\"{a}hler potentials and the corresponding Lie\nalgebras are constructed now explicitly for all unitary representations of any\ncompact simple Lie group. The quantum dynamics can be represented in terms of a\nphase-space path integral, and the action principle appears in the\nsemi-classical approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 1994 19:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We denote this family by $\\{B_n^m\\}_{n \\ge\nm+1}$ where $n,m \\in \\N$. The family $\\{ B_n^1 \\}_{n \\in \\N}$ is the set of\nclassical braid groups on $n$ strings. The group $B_n^m$ is the set of motions\nof $n$ unordered points in $\\C^m$, so that at any time during the motion, each\n$m+1$ of the points span the whole of $\\C^m$ as an affine space. There is a map\nfrom $B_n^m$ to the symmetric group on $n$ letters. We let $P_n^m$ denote the\nkernel of this map. In this paper we are mainly interested in understanding\n$P_n^2$. We give a presentation of a group $PL_n$ which maps surjectively onto\n$P_n^2$. We also show the surjection $PL_n \\to P_n^2$ induces an isomorphism on\nfirst and second integral homology and conjecture that it is an isomorphism. We\nthen find an infinitesimal presentation of the group $P_n^2$. Finally, we also\nconsider the analagous groups where points lie in $\\P^m$ instead of $\\C^m$.\nThese groups generalize of the classical braid groups on the sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 1994 21:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
