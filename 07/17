The core design of the abstract machine is given in detail,\nincluding the compilation process from a high-level specification language to\nthe abstract machine language and the implementation of the abstract\ninstructions. We thus apply methods that were proved useful in computer science\nto the study of natural languages: a grammar specified using the formalism is\nendowed with an operational semantics. Currently, our machine supports the\nunification of simple feature structures, unification of sequences of such\nstructures, cyclic structures and disjunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 1994 06:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
