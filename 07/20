The resulting manifolds have (if one identifies imaginary time)\ntopology $S^1 \\times R \\times S^2 $ and Euler number $\\chi = 0$ in contrast to\nthe non-extreme case with $\\chi=2$. The entropy of extreme $U(1)$ dilaton black\nholes is already known to be zero. We include a review of some recent ideas due\nto Hawking on the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om case. By regarding all extreme black\nholes as having an inner boundary, we conclude that the entropy of {\\sl all}\nextreme black holes, including $[U(1)]^2$ black holes, vanishes. We discuss the\nrelevance of this to the vanishing of quantum corrections and the idea that the\nfunctional integral for extreme holes gives a Witten Index. We have studied\nalso the topology of ``moduli space'' of multi black holes. The quantum\nmechanics on black hole moduli spaces is expected to be supersymmetric despite\nthe fact that they are not HyperK\\\"ahler since the corresponding geometry has\ntorsion unlike the BPS monopole case. Finally, we describe the possibility of\nextreme black hole fission for states with an energy gap. The energy released,\nas a proportion of the initial rest mass, during the decay of an\nelectro-magnetic black hole is 300 times greater than that released by the\nfission of an ${}^{235} U$ nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 1994 05:26:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 1994 07:12:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 1994 04:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
