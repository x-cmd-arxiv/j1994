Those advantages are: (1) a comfortable expansion age that avoids the\ncurrent age crisis; (2) a cold dark matter power spectrum whose shape is in\ngood agreement with the observational data and (3) which predicts an abundance\nof clusters in close agreement with that of x-ray selected galaxy clusters; (4)\na nonbaryonic to baryonic mass ratio that is in better agreement with recent\ndeterminations based upon cluster x-ray studies.

The task is accomplished in three\nsteps. The first step is the construction of a modified cobar complex adapted\nto a non-coassociative comultiplication. The following two steps each involve a\nnew, highly non-trivial, construction. The first construction, essentially\ncombinatorial, defines a differential graded Lie algebra structure on the\nsimplicial chain complex of the associahedra. The second construction, of a\nmore algebraic nature, is the definition of map of differential graded Lie\nalgebras from the complex defined above to the algebra of derivations on the\nbar resolution. Using the existence of this map and the acyclicity of the\nassociahedra we can define a so-called homotopy comodule structure on the bar\nresolution of a general Drinfeld algebra. This in turn allows us to define the\ndesired cohomology theory in terms of a complex which consists, roughly\nspeaking, of the bimodule and bicomodule maps from the bar resolution to the\nmodified cobar resolution. The complex is bigraded but not a bicomplex as in\nthe Gerstenhaber-Schack theory for bialgebra deformations. The new components\nof the coboundary operator are defined via the constructions mentioned above.\nAs an application we show that the Drinfel'd deformation of the universal\nenveloping algebra of a simple Lie algebra is not a jump deformation.
