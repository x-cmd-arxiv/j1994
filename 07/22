We point out that\ninteractions between the flux tubes will be dominated by coherent effects\nstemming from the turbulent wakes created as the fluid streams by the flux\ntubes. Balancing the attraction caused by shielding effects with turbulent\ndiffusion we find that flux tubes have typical radii comparable to the local\nMach number squared times the large scale eddy length, are arranged in a one\ndimensional fractal pattern, have a radius of curvature comparable to the\nlargest scale eddies in the turbulence, and have an internal magnetic pressure\ncomparable to the ambient pressure. When the average magnetic energy density is\nmuch less than the turbulent energy density the radius, internal magnetic field\nand curvature scale of the flux tubes will be smaller than these estimates.\nRealistic resistivity does not alter the macroscopic properties of the fluid or\nthe large scale magnetic field. In either case we show that the Sweet-Parker\nreconnection rate is much faster than an eddy turnover time. Realistic stellar\nplasmas are expected to either be in the ideal limit (e.g. the solar\nphotosphere) or the resistive limit (most of the solar convection zone). All\ncurrent numerical simulations of three dimensional MHD turbulence are in the\nviscous regime and are inapplicable to stars or accretion disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 1994 21:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The associated Higgs field is a tetrad gravitational field $h$\nrepresented by a section of the quotient $\\Si$ of $LX$ by $SO(3,1)$. The\nfeature of gravity as a Higgs field issues from the fact that, in the presence\nof different tetrad fields, there are nonequivalent representations of\ncotangent vectors to $X^4$ by Dirac's matrices.
