We give\nexact expressions for the rotation curves for these models. We also find that\nthe algebraic relation is a very good approximation for exponential disks. The\nalgebraic relation outside the disk is then extended into the disk to derive an\nimproved approximation for the MOND rotation curve of disk galaxies that\nrequires only knowledge of the Newtonian curve and the surface density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 1994 08:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The data cannot\ncurrently constrain a large number of cosmological parameters, but it is clear\nthat there is more information than just the normalization of the models. Here\nwe use the data to constrain a second parameter, namely the amplitude of the\nDoppler peak, using a phenomenological approach to the power spectrum. We find\nthat the data prefer a peak of height ~3, with a purely flat spectrum ruled out\nat the 95%CL. Although there are concerns about possible foregrounds and\nnon-Gaussian fluctuations, we believe that the existence of a peak at\ndegree-scales is established by the data. This immediately implies that\nreionization was unimportant for the CMB. It also potentially leads to\ndifficulties for models where the fluctuations were produced by topological\ndefects. Independent constraints on Omega_B, on the slope n, etc. will need to\nwait for further data. At the moment, the simple presence of a Doppler peak\nshould be seen as strong supporting evidence for standard dark matter-dominated\nmodels with some few percent of baryons at z=1000.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 1994 11:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The charge on the island and the decay rates are calculated. In the\nstrong tunneling regime also nondegenerate states are affected by tunneling.\nStrong-coupling scaling renormalizes the effective capacitance, a result which\nwe confirm by Monte Carlo simulations.
