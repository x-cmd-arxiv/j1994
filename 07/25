Dust features are\nclassified as `arcs', which have heights and scale radius of about 100 to 300\npc, connecting two or more dark clouds, and `loops' and `bubbles', which are\ndeveloped forms of arcs, expanding into the disk-halo interface. These have\ndiameters of a few hundred pc to $\\sim 1$ kpc. Among the bubbles, we notice a\npeculiar round-shaped bubble above the nucleus, which could be a large-diameter\n($\\sim 300$ pc) supernova remnant exploded in the halo over the nucleus. We\nalso find `vertical dust streamers', which comprise bunches of narrow filaments\nwith a thickness of a few tens of pc and are almost perpendicular to the\ngalactic plane, extending coherently for 1 to 2 kpc toward the halo. Finally,\nwe note `short vertical dust filaments' (or spicules) are found in the central\nregion. We interpret these features as due to three-dimensional structures of\ngas extending from the disk into the halo. We propose a `boiling disk' model\nwhere the filamentary features are produced by star-forming activity in the\ndisk as well as the influence of magnetic fluxes. We discuss the implication of\nthe model for the chemical evolution of the ISM in a galaxy disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 1994 08:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

After a brief review of\nthe main properties of anyons, we present the details of the anyonic\nrealization of all deformed classical Lie algebras in terms of anyonic\noscillators. The deformation parameter of the quantum groups is directly\nrelated to the statistics parameter of the anyons. Such a realization is a\ndirect generalization of the Schwinger construction in terms of fermions and is\nbased on a sort of bosonization formula which yields the generators of the\ndeformed algebra in terms of the undeformed ones. The entire procedure is well\ndefined on two-dimensional lattices, but it can be consistently reduced also to\none-dimensional chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 1994 10:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
