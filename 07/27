Within a framework where LMXBs in GCs are generated\nvia tidal captures in high-density clusters and (2+1) encounters in low-density\nglobulars, the higher incidence of LMXBs with increasing metallicity is shown\nto be {\\it intrinsic} and not just a by-product of other effects. Two possible\nmechanisms are examined: the first one assumes a dependence of the cluster IMF\non metallicity as recently published in the literature. The observed LMBXs,\nmore frequently occurring in metal rich clusters, agrees with the predicted\nnumber of NS only if metallicity accounts for a minor contribution to the\nobserved variation of the IMF slope. Other alternatives explored, such as the\ntotal variation of the observed IMF slopes is due to (a) just metallicity and\n(b) the combination of metallicity and position in the Galaxy lead to a\nclear-cut disagreement with the data. The second mechanism assumes that, at\nfixed cluster density, the rate of tidal captures depends on radius and mass of\nthe capturing star. Based on standard stellar models, stars with higher metal\ncontent have wider radii and higher masses, hence the rate of tidal captures\nincreases with increasing metallicity. From the order of magnitude computations\nmade, this new effect by itself could explain the observed ratio of 4 between\nthe frequencies of X-ray clusters in the metal-rich and metal-poor groups we\nobservationally determined. However, there is no reason to exclude that both\nmechanisms can be at work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 1994 18:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We first derive an exact\nconnection between the string tension and a certain correlation function of the\nmany-body string bit system. This connection is made for an arbitrary\ninteraction potential between string bits and relies on an exact dipole sum\nrule. We then review an earlier calculation by Goldstone of the low energy\nexcitations of a polymer chain using RPA. We assess the accuracy of the RPA by\ncalculating the first order corrections. For this purpose we specialize to the\nunique scale invariant potential, namely an attractive delta function potential\nin two (transverse) dimensions.
