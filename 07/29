Our computations rely on a\nmultistate smearing method introduced previously, with smearing functions\ngenerated from a relativistic lattice quark model. Systematic errors arising\nfrom excited state contamination, finite volume effects, and the chiral\nextrapolation for the light quarks are estimated. We obtain continuum results\nfor the mass splitting M_{B_s}- M_{B_u} = 86 (+/-)12(stat) {+7/-9}(syst) MeV,\nthe ratio of decay constants f_{B_s}/f_{B_u} = 1.22 (+/-)0.04(stat) (+/-)0.02\n(syst). For the B-meson decay constant we separately exhibit the sizable\nuncertainties in the extrapolation to the continuum limit a -> 0 and higher\norder perturbative matching. We obtain f_{B} = 188 (+/-)23(stat) (+/-)15(syst)\n{+26/-0}(extrap) (+/-)14 (pert) MeV. ----- [Postscript version of paper\navailable by anonymous ftp at fncrd6.fnal.gov.

We\ndiscuss three supersymmetric extensions of the KP hierarchy (MRSKP, \\SKP2, and\nJSKP).

The\nusual approximations made in the evaluation of the related kaon selfenergy are\nshown to fail badly. We also find new interaction mechanisms which provide\nappreciable corrections to the kaon selfenergy. Some of these contribute to the\nimaginary part below pion creation threshold.

Uncertainties remain in the dispersive part of the optical potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 1994 09:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
