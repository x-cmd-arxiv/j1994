However, a recent\nreanalysis of the boron abundance in the Pop II halo star HD140283 suggests\nthat B/H may be larger than previously reported, by as much as a factor of 4.\nThis would yield a B/Be ratio lying in the range $14 \\la {\\rm B/Be} \\la 50$.\nThe possibility of a high Pop II B/Be ratio stresses the importance of the\nupper limit to the B/Be ratio arising from cosmic ray production. It is found\nthat the limit to cosmic ray-produced B/Be depends upon the assumed cosmic ray\nspectrum. For any Pop II comic ray spectrum that is a single power law in\neither total energy per nucleon or in momentum the B/Be ratio is constrained to\nlie in the range $7.6 \\la$ B/Be $\\la 14$. Thus, if the new B/Be ratio is\ncorrect, it requires either a bimodal cosmic ray flux with a large low energy\ncomponent, or for another B source, possibly the proposed $\\nu$-process in\nsupernovae, either of which may be helpful in explaining the observed\n\\bor11/\\bor10 ratio. Finally, it is noted that the boron reanalysis highlights\nthe uncertainty in our knowledge of the B/Be ratio, and the need for additional\ndata on Be and B abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 1994 19:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The predicted\npeculiar velocities are free of Malmquist bias in the absence of\nmulti-streaming, provided no selection criteria are imposed on the measurement\nof circular velocities. This procedure can be considered as a generalized\nsmoothing algorithm of the peculiar velocity field, and is particularly useful\nfor comparison to the smoothed gravity field derived from full-sky galaxy\nredshift catalogs such as the IRAS surveys.
