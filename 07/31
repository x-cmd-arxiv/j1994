The algorithm preserves as\nmuch information from the grammars as possible, using negative restriction to\ndefine equivalence classes. Addition of a simple data structure leads to an\norder of magnitude improvement in execution time over a naive implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 1994 16:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
