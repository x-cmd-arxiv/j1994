We begin with a perturbative\nstudy to one loop and show explicitly that the mechanism of dissipation via\nparticle production cannot be explained with a simple derivative term in the\nequation of motion. The dissipative contribution is non-local and there does\nnot exist a local (Markovian) limit at zero temperature. Furthermore, we show\nthat both an amplitude as well as a one-loop calculation present instabilities,\nrequiring a non-perturbative resummation. Within the same approximations, we\nstudy an O(2) linear sigma model that allows to study dissipation by Goldstone\nbosons.\n  We find infrared divergences that require non-perturbative resummation in\norder to understand the long-time dynamics. We obtain a perturbative\n  Langevin equation that exhibits a generalized fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation, with non-Markovian kernels and colored noise. We then study a\n  Hartree approximation and clearly exhibit dissipative effects related to the\nthresholds to particle production. The asymptotic dynamics depends on the\ncoupling and initial conditions but does not seem to lead to exponential\nrelaxation. The effect of dissipation by Goldstone bosons is studied\nnon-perturbatively in the large N limit in an O(N) theory. Dissipation produced\nby Goldstone bosons dramatically changes the picture of the phase transition.\nWe find the remarkable result that for ``slow-roll'' initial conditions (with\nthe expectation value of the field initially near the origin) the final value\nof the expectation value of the scalar field is very close to its initial\nvalue. We find that the minima of the effective action depend on the initial\nconditions. We provide extensive numerical analysis of the dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 1994 15:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}
