Whether photons move faster or slower than $c$ depends only on\nthe lower or higher energy density of the modified vacuum, respectively.\nPhysically, a higher energy density is characterized by the presence of\nadditional particles (real or virtual) in the vacuum whereas a lower one stems\nfrom the absence of some virtual modes.
