We explore the possibility that such isosinglet quarks have low or\nintermediate scale masses, but do not mediate rapid proton decay because of a\ndiscrete symmetry. By imposing the discrete gauge anomaly cancellation\nconditions, we show that the simplest way to achieve this is to extend the Z_3\n\"baryon parity\" of Ibanez and Ross to the isosinglet quark superfields. This\ncan be done in three distinct ways. This strategy is not consistent with grand\nunification with a simple gauge group, but may find a natural place in\nsuperstring-inspired models, for example. An interesting feature of this\nscenario is that proton decay is absolutely forbidden.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 1994 13:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The $\\W_3$ generators $T$ and $W$\nthen appear respectively as functions of the induced world line metric and the\nextrinsic curvature. We also show how the equations of motion for the standard\nrelativistic particle arise from those of the rigid particle whenever it is\nconsistent to impose the ``zero-curvature gauge'', and how to rewrite them in\nterms of the $\\KdV$ operator. The relation between particle models and\nintegrable systems is further pursued in the case of the spinning particle,\nwhose equations of motion are closely related to the $\\SKdV$ operator.
