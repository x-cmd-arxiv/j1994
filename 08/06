The hypothesis explains why BLLs do\nnot undergo the strong evolution seen in other active galactic nuclei since it\nnaturally predicts that the space density of BLLs should increase with cosmic\ntime, as shown by recent observations. Numerical models reproduce, with\nreasonable parameters, the known redshift and magnitude counts of BL Lac\nobjects. It is assumed that radio-quiet as well as radio-loud quasars are\ncapable of generating jets but that jets are snuffed in young radio-quiet\nobjects and only emerge in aged ones. I argue that the observations allow this\nassumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 1994 18:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
