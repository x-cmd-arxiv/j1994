Several possible organizations of spin vectors are\ninvestigated by means of statistical analyses of the three-dimensional spin\nvector maps. The results indicate that there exists no significant alignment of\ngalaxy spin vectors with respect to the supergalactic plane, the supergalactic\naxis, or the cylindrical axis of the filament itself. No tendency for linear\nalignment of spin vectors towards any specific direction was detected. We also\nobtain a statistically negative result for azimuthal, radial, and circul\nar-helical orientation of spin vectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 1994 18:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
