Demailly has introduced a very interesting invariant --- the\nSeshadri constant $\\epsilon(L,x)$ --- which in effect measures how positive $L$\nis locally near a given point $x \\in X$. For instance, Seshadri's criterion for\nampleness may be phrased as stating that $L$ is ample if and only if there\nexists a positive number $e > 0$ such that $\\epsilon(L,x) > e$ for all $x \\in\nX$, and if $L$ is VERY ample, then $\\epsilon(L,x) \\ge 1$ for every $x$. We\nprove the somewhat surprising result that in each dimension $n$ there is a\nuniform lower bound on the Seshadri constant of an ample line bundle $L$ at a\nvery general point of $X$. Specifically, $\\epsilon(L,x) \\ge (1/n) $ for all $x\n\\in X$ outside the union of countably many proper subvarieties of $X$. Examples\nof Miranda show that there cannot exist a bound (independent of $X$ and $L$)\nthat holds at every point. The proof draws inspiration from two sources: first,\nthe arguments used to prove boundedness of Fano manifolds of Picard number one;\nand secondly some of the geometric ideas involving zero-estimates appearing in\nthe work of Faltings and others on Diophantine approximation and transcendence\ntheory. We give some elementary applications of the main theorem to adjoint and\npluricanonical linear series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 1994 19:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

From a theoretical point of view it is an interesting\ninterplay of particle and nuclear physics. The effective transition operator,\ndepending on the gauge model, is in general described in terms of a combination\nof four terms of transition operators (isoscalar and isovector, Fermi-like as\nwell as axial vector-like). The experimentally most interesting ground state to\nground state transition is adequately described in terms of the usual proton\nand neutron form factors. These were computed in both the shell model and RPA.\nSince it is of interest to know the portion of the strength exhausted by the\ncoherent (ground state to ground state) transition, the total transition rate\nto all final states must also be computed. This was done i) in RPA by\nexplicitly summing over all final states ii) in the context of the closure\napproximation (using shell model and RPA for constructing the initial state)\nand iii) in the context of nuclear matter mapped into nuclei via a local\ndensity approximation. We found that, apart from small local oscillations, the\nconversion rate keeps increasing from light to heavy nuclear elements. We also\nfind that the coherent mode is dominant (it exhausts more than 90\\% of the sum\nrule). Various gauge models are discussed. In general the predicted branching\nratio is much smaller compared to the present experimental limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 1994 12:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}
