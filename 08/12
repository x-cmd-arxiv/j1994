The Hamiltonian\nformulation allows a natural extension of the formalism to growths with either\nisotropic or anisotropic surface tension. It is shown that the curvature term\ncan be included as a surface energy in the Hamiltonian that gives rise to\nrepulsion between the quasi-particles and the surface. This repulsion prevents\ncusp singularities from forming along the surface at any finite time and\nregularizes the growth. An explicit example is computed to demonstrate the\nregularizing effect. Noise is then introduced as in traditional statistical\nmechanical formalism and a measure is defined that allows analysis of the\nspatial distribution of the quasi-particles. Finally, a relation is derived\nbetween this distribution and the growth probability along the growing surface.\nSince the spatial distribution of quasi-particles flows to a stable limiting\nform, this immediately translates into predictability of the asymptotic\nmorphology of the surface.
