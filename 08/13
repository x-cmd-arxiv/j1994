The emission of transiently heated particles is taken\ninto account, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We obtain an\nacceptable fit to most of the spectrum, including the PAH infrared bands. At\nsubmillimetre wavelengths the observed emission is larger than the model\npredicts, indicating that large dust conglomerates (``f{}luffy grains'') may be\nneeded as an additional constituent. The fit favours a distance of $\\ge 2\n\\,$kpc, which implies that BD~+30$^\\circ$3639 has evolved from a massive\nprogenitor of several solar masses. A low dust-to-gas mass ratio is found in\nthe ionised region. The calculations yield an original mass-loss rate of\n$2\\times10^{-4} \\msolar \\peryr$ on the Asymptotic Giant Branch.

The action of this impulsive force is completely equivalent to\nadjusting the nuclear velocities in the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling\nvector so as to conserve energy, a procedure which is widely used in surface\nhopping trajectory methods. This is the first time the precise connection\nbetween these two formulations of the nonadiabatic dynamics problem has been\nconsidered. We also demonstrate that the stationary phase approximation to the\nreduced propagator at the heart of Pechukas' theory is not unitary due to its\nneglect of nonstationary paths. As such mixed quantum-classical evolution\nschemes based on this approximation are not norm conserving and in general must\nfail to give the correct branching between different competing electronic\nstates. Tully's phase coherent, fewest switches branching algorithm is\nguaranteed to conserve the norm. The branching between different alternatives\npredicted by this approach, however, may be inaccurate, due to use of the\napproximate local dynamics. We explore the relative merits of these different\napproximations using Tully's 1D two state example scattering problems for which\nnumerically exact results are easily obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 1994 19:28:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 1994 17:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
