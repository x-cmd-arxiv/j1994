At the low densities considered, the\npopulations of the excited states of hydrogen are governed mainly by\nphotoionization and recombination, and scattering dominates absorptive opacity.\nWe match the asymptotic expressions for the spectral energy density $\\Jnu$ at\nthe photosphere, whose location at each frequency is determined by a\nfirst-order calculation of the deviation of $\\Jnu$ from the Planck function\n$\\Bnu$.

The nature of LINERs has, however, remained controversial because an\nAGN-like nonstellar continuum source has not been directly observed in them. We\nreport the detection of bright, unresolved (FWHM $\\ltorder 0.1''$) point\nsources of UV ($\\sim 2300$ \\AA) emission in the nuclei of nine nearby galaxies\nfrom a complete sample of 110 nearby galaxies imaged with {\\it HST}.\nGround-based optical spectroscopy reveals that five of the nuclei are LINERs,\nthree are starburst nuclei, and one is a Seyfert nucleus. The observed UV flux\nin each of the five LINERs implies an ionizing flux that is sufficient to\naccount for the observed emission lines through photoionization. The detection\nof a strong UV continuum in the LINERs argues against shock excitation as the\nsource of the observed emission lines, and supports the idea that\nphotoionization excites the lines in at least some objects of this class. Among\nthe Northern-hemisphere galaxies in the sample, 26 are LINERs, of which only\nthe above five LINERs have a detected nuclear UV source. There are no obvious\ndifferences in the optical line intensity ratios between the UV-bright and\nUV-dark LINERs. If all LINERs are photoionized, then the continuum source is\nunobscured along our line of sight in $5/26\\approx 20\\%$ of LINERs.\nAlternatively, spectrally-similar LINERs may be produced by various excitation\nmechanisms, with photoionization responsible in only about 20\\% of the cases.\nThe high angular resolution allows us to set upper limits, typically several\nparsecs, on the physical size of the compact star-cluster or AGN-type continuum\nsource that is emitting the UV light in these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 1994 14:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
