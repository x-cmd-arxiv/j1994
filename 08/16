It is shown here that the stars within the LMC play a\ndominant role as gravitational lenses and can indeed account for the observed\nevents. The MACHO event and one of the EROS events lie within the bar for which\nthe probability of microlensing is consistent with being caused by an object\nwithin the LMC. If the stars within the LMC play a dominant role as lenses, the\nevents should be concentrated towards the center of the LMC. If MACHOs play a\ndominant role as lenses then, for a given number of monitored stars, the events\nshould be uniformly distributed over the whole of the LMC. Thus the galactic\nand the LMC lenses can be statistically distinguished in most cases. It is\nfurther shown that, under certain conditions, the light curve of an event\ncaused by a star within the LMC would be different from the one caused by a\nMACHO. This can also be a distinguishing signature, and seems to have been\nobserved in case of the MACHO event. The fit discrepancy near the peak which\nthe authors say ``is not yet understood\" would be a natural consequence if the\nevent is caused by an object within the LMC, which further indicates that the\nlensing is due to a low mass star within the LMC itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 1994 20:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Adopting a different\nsmoothing procedure for the discreetly sampled data (individual galaxy images),\nwe effectively reduce the shot noise in the KS procedure.

In strong magnetic\nfields, the cross-section to electron scattering is strongly suppressed in one\npolarization state, so super-Eddington fluxes can be radiated while the plasma\nremains in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model offers a somewhat natural\nexplanation for the observation of similarity between spectra from bursts of\nvarying intensity. The radiation produced in the model is found to be linearly\npolarized to about 1 part in 1000 in a direction determined by the local\nmagnetic field, and the large intensity variations between bursts are\nunderstood as a change in the radiating area on the source. Therefore, the\npolarization may vary as a function of burst intensity, since the complex\nstructure of the magnetic field may be more apparent for larger radiating\nareas. It is shown that for radiation transfer calculations in this limit of\nsuper-strong magnetic fields it is sufficient to solve the radiation transfer\nequations for the low opacity state rather than the coupled equations for both.\nWith this approximation, standard stellar atmosphere techniques are utilized to\ncalculate the model energy spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 1994 08:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
