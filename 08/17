However, the light from these\n``undetected'' galaxies still modulates the surface brightness of the\nbackground sky. Clusters can appear as 10\"-1.5' sized fluctuations in the\nsurface brightness of the EBL. The fluctuations have central surface\nbrightnesses between roughly 26 and 28 mag/sqr-arcsec (in V) for clusters\nbetween z=1 and z=2, and are brighter than the fluctuations produced by\nbackground field galaxies. While such low surface brightnesses are difficult to\nachieve with direct high-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that they are\neasily reached in short exposures through smoothing the sky in very flat CCD\nimages. For a reasonable extrapolation of the properties and space densities of\nclusters and groups, we find that for a wide range of cosmological assumptions\nthere should be tens of clusters per square degree visible in the extragalactic\nbackground. The detection rate can range between 0.1 and 100 clusters per\nsquare degree, for extreme assumptions about the rate of cluster and galaxy\nevolution. Drift scans provide sufficient accuracy of flat-fielding to make the\nmethod discussed in this paper an efficient techinque for finding candidate\nhigh redshift clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 1994 19:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As impact parameter\nincreases, the angle of inclination of the fronts relative to beam axis\ndecreases, and in-between the fronts a weak tangential discontinuity develops.\nHot matter exposed to the vacuum in directions perpendicular to shock motion\n(and parallel to fronts), starts to expand sideways, early within reactions.\nExpansion in the direction of shock motion follows after the shocks propagate\nthrough nuclei, but due to the delay does not acquire same strength.
