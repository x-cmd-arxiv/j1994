Deceleration and other\nfirst-order effects of the solar wind, including convection, are incorporated\ninto a numerical code for simulating the transport of energetic particles along\nthe interplanetary magnetic field. We use this code to model the transport of\nsolar flare protons. We find that including deceleration can increase the decay\nrate of the near-Earth intensity by 75\\% more than would be expected based on\nadvection from higher momenta, due to an interplay with diffusive processes.\nImproved response functions are derived for the impulsive injection of\nparticles near the Sun, and it is found that neglecting deceleration leads to\nincorrect estimates of the scattering mean free path based on the intensity\ndecay alone, especially for lower-energy particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 1994 16:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
