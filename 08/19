The basic theoretical tool of cosmological\nperturbation theory is described, as well as the possible origin of the density\nperturbation as a vacuum fluctuation during inflation. Then, after normalising\nthe spectrum to fit the cosmic microwave background anisotropy measured by\nCOBE, some versions of the standard model are compared with a variety of data\ncoming from observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters. The recent COBE\nanalysis of G\\'{o}rski and collaborators is used, which gives a significantly\nhigher normalization than earlier ones. The comparison with galaxy and cluster\ndata is done using linear theory, supplemented by the Press-Schechter formula\nwhen discussing object abundances of rich clusters and of damped Lyman alpha\nsystems. By focussing on the smoothed density contrast as a function of scale,\nthe observational data can be conveniently illustrated on a single figure,\nfacilitating easy comparison with theory. The spectral index is constrained to\n$0.6<n<1.1$, and in particle physics motivated models that predict significant\ngravitational waves the lower limit is tightened to $0.8$.
