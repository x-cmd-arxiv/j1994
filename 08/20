Faint\ngalaxies are found to be more weakly clustered (by a factor of at least two)\ncompared to galaxies observed locally. Clustering amplitudes are closer to\nmodel predictions in the red than in the blue. The weak clustering of faint\ngalaxies cannot be explained by any plausible model of clustering evolution\nwith redshift. However, one possible explanation of the clustering properties\nof intermediate redshift galaxies is that they resemble those of starburst\ngalaxies and H II region galaxies, which are observed locally to possess weak\nclustering amplitudes. Our clustering amplitudes are also similar to those of\nnearby late-type galaxies, which are observed to be more weakly clustered than\nearly-type galaxies A simple, self-consistent model is presented that predicts\nthe fraction of galaxies in the ``excess'' population at intermediate\nredshifts, and correctly matches observed color distributions. The available\ndata on the clustering properties of faint galaxies are consistent with this\nmodel if the ``excess'' population of faint blue galaxies is also the weakly\nclustered population. Evidence is presented that the power-law slope of the\nangular correlation function becomes shallower at fainter magnitudes.
