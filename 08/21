Following the demise of the SSC, a number of\npossible upgrades to the Tevatron complex, beyond construction of the Main\nInjector, are being discussed. Using existing technology, it appears possible\nto increase the luminosity of the $\\bar{p}p$ Collider to at least\n$10^{33}$cm$^{-2}$sec$^{-1}$ (Tevatron-Star) and to increase the beam energy to\n2 TeV (DiTevatron). Fixed target beam of energy about 1.5 TeV could also be\ndelivered. Leaving the existing Tevatron in the tunnel and constructing\nbypasses around the collider halls would allow simultaneous 800 GeV fixed\ntarget and $\\sqrt{s}$ = 4 TeV collider operation. These upgrades would give\nFermilab an exciting physics program which would be complementary to the LHC,\nand they would lay the groundwork for the construction of a possible post-LHC\nultra-high energy hadron collider.

Using a new Ansatz for the LATTICE potential in terms of the\ncontinuum coupling, we can fit quenched and unquenched Monte Carlo results for\nthe potential down to ONE lattice spacing, and at the same time extract the\nrunning coupling to high precision. We compare our Ansatz with 1-loop results\nfor the lattice potential, and use the coupling from our fits to quantitatively\ncheck the accuracy of 2-loop evolution, compare with the Lepage-Mackenzie\nestimate of the coupling extracted from the plaquette, and determine Sommer's\nscale $r_0$ much more accurately than previously possible.
