It is shown that if the concentration of H$_{2}$formation sites is\nlow and resurfacing is active, fractal structure of grains enhances their\nalignment. Studying the influence of grain surface physics and chemistry on the\nalignment we found that there exist two critical values of grain sizes, and the\nalignment of smaller grains is expected to decrease as compared to the\npredictions of the Purcell's theory (1979). One of the critical sizes is due to\nintensified poisoning of active sites, while the other is a result of a finite\nvalue of the imaginary part of magnetic susceptibility in the limit of high\nangular velocities. On the contrary, if active sites completely cover grain\nsurface, suprathermal rotation, and therefore efficient alignment, is possible\nonly for a limited range of grain sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 1994 19:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
