Finally, in the critical $q\\to 1$ limit, we give\nsome intriguing expressions for the number of $L$-step paths on the A$_3$\nDynkin diagram with tadpoles in terms of the E$_8$ Cartan matrix. All our\nfindings confirm the E$_8$ and E$_7$ structure of the dilute A$_3$ model found\nrecently by means of the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 1994 02:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
