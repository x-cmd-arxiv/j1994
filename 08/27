Assuming isotropy and\nusing the velocity dispersion and surface brightness profiles, the Jeans\nequation uniquely determines the mass density profile. In the two\ncentrally-concentrated clusters, M15 and 47~Tuc, we find that the mass-to-light\nratios (M/L's) reach minima around 1\\arcmin, and increase by more than a factor\nof four towards the cluster centers. For the two less centrally concentrated\nclusters, the M/L decreases monotonically all the way into the center. All four\nclusters exhibit an increase in the M/L's in their outer parts. If the\nvariations in the M/L's are due to equipartition of energy between different\nmass stars, then we attribute the central increases to massive remnants and the\nouter increases to low-mass stars (m$<0.3$M$_\\odot$). By applying the crude\napproximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium, we derive the present-day\nmass function for each cluster. In the central 2--3 parsecs, 0.7--1.5 M$_\\odot$\nobjects provide the bulk of the cluster mass.
