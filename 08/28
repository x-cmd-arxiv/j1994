We find it only\ndescribes an incompressible fluid when the two lengths of the cylinder are\ncomparable. As the radius is made smaller at fixed area, we observe a\ncontinuous transition to the charge density wave Tao-Thouless state. We also\npresent some exact properties of the wave function in its polynomial form. We\nthen study the edge excitations of the quantum Hall incompressible fluid\nmodeled by the Laughlin wave function. The exponent describing the fluctuation\nof the edge predicted by recent theories is shown to be identical with\nnumerical calculations. In particular, for $\\nu=1/3$, we obtain the occupation\namplitudes of edge state $n(k)$ for 4-10 electron size systems. When plotted as\na function of the scaled wave vector they become essentially free of\nfinite-size effects. The resulting curve obtains a very good agreement with the\nappropriate infinite-size Calogero-Sutherland model occupation numbers.\nFinally, we numerically obtain $n(k)$ of the edge excitations for some pairing\nstates which may be relevant to the $\\nu=5/2$ incompressible Hall state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 1994 23:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 1994 23:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We argue that in order to explain the tendency of\nparity violating asymmetries measured in $^{233}$Th to have a common sign,\ndoorways that contribute to parity mixing must be found in the same energy\nneighbourhood of the measured resonance. The mechanism of parity mixing in this\ncase of nearby doorways is closely related to the intermediate structure\nobserved in nuclear reactions in which compound states are excited. We note\nthat in the region of interest ($^{233}$Th) nuclei exhibit octupole\ndeformations which leads to the existence of nearby parity doublets. These\nparity doublets are then used as doorways in a model for parity mixing. The\ncontribution of such mechanism is estimated in a simple model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 1994 10:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
