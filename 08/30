The distortion measures the\ncombination $\\gamma/(1-\\kappa)$ of shear $\\gamma$ and surface density $\\kappa$.\nFrom this we obtain an expression for the gradient of $\\log (1 - \\kappa)$ in\nterms of directly measurable quantities. This allows one to reconstruct $1 -\n\\kappa$ up to an arbitrary constant multiplier. Recent work has emphasised an\nambiguity in the relation between the distortion and $\\gamma/(1-\\kappa)$. Here\nwe show that the functional relation depends only on the parity of the images,\nso if one has data extending to large radii, and if the critical lines can be\nvisually identified (as lines along which the distortion diverges), this\nambiguity is resolved. Moreover, we show that for a generic 2-dimensional lens\nit is possible to locally determine the parity from the distortion. The\narbitrary multiplier, which may in fact take a different value in each region\nbounded by the contour $\\kappa = 1$, can be determined by requiring that the\nmean surface excess vanish at large radii and that the gradient of $\\kappa$\nshould be continuous across $\\kappa = 1$. We show how these ideas might be\nimplemented to reconstruct the surface density, if necessary without use of the\ndata in regions where determination of the parity is insecure, and we show how\none can measure the mass contained within an aperture, again, if necessary,\nwithout using data within the aperture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 1994 20:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We provide a thorough updating of the analysis of the three\ncomponents of the decay: 1) Direct CP violation, 2) CP violation through the\nmass matrix and 3) CP-conserving (two-photon) contributions. First the chiral\ncalculation of the K_S -> pi0 e+ e- rate, due to Ecker, Pich and de Rafael\n(EPR), is updated to include recent results on the nonleptonic amplitude. Then\nwe systematically explore the uncertainties in this method. These appear to be\nso large that they will obscure the direct CP violation unless it is possible\nto measure the K_S -> pi0 e+ e- rate. The CP-conserving amplitude remains\nsomewhat uncertain, but present indications are such that there may be a\nsizable CP-violating asymmetry in the e+, e- energies from the interference of\nthe CP-conserving and CP-violating amplitudes and this may potentially be\nuseful in determining whether direct CP violation is present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 1994 15:31:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2001 21:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}
