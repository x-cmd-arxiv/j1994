Due to the fairly bright flux threshold of\nthe cluster sample, these correlations cannot be interpreted as being due to an\nenvironmental effect of the clusters on the quasar activity. The most likely\ninterpretation employed in RH94 was the effect of gravitational lensing by the\nforeground clusters, though the required magnification to explain the observed\ncorrelations has to be considerably higher than obtained from simple mass\nmodels for the clusters. We have repeated the analysis of RH94 using a\ndifferent QSO sample, namely radio quasars and radio galaxies from the 1-Jy\nsample. In accordance with RH, we detect a statistically significant\ncorrelation between Zwicky clusters and 1-Jy sources with intermediate redshift\n($z\\approx 1$), but fail to detect significant effects for higher-redshift\nsources. In addition, we detect a highly significant underdensity of\nlow-redshift radio sources around Zwicky clusters, for which an environmental\ninterpretation seems to be most reasonable. Our result for the overdensity of\n$z\\sim 1$ sources is in good agreement with previous results and can possibly\nbe interpreted as a lensing effect, though we have not tried to quantitatively\ninvestigate a lensing model. Other interpretations, such as patchy dust\nobscuration, can not explain the observed effect and its tendency with\nredshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 1994 17:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The amplitudes of the interference maxima are\nchanged by a factor which depends upon a double line integral of the photon\ntwo-point function around the closed path of the electrons. The interference\npattern is sensitive to shifts in the vacuum fluctuations in regions from which\nthe electrons are excluded. Thus this effect combines aspects of both the\nCasimir and the Aharonov-Bohm effects. The coupling to the quantized\nelectromagnetic field tends to decrease the amplitude of the interference\noscillations, and hence is a form of decoherence. The contributions due to\nphoton emission and to vacuum fluctuations may be separately identified. It is\nto be expected that photon emission leads to decoherence, as it can reveal\nwhich path an electron takes. It is less obvious that vacuum fluctuations also\ncan cause decoherence. What is directly observable is a shift in the\nfluctuations due, for example, to the presence of a conducting plate. In the\ncase of electrons moving parallel to conducting boundaries, the dominant\ndecohering influence is that of the vacuum fluctuations. The shift in the\ninterference amplitudes can be of the order of a few percent, so experimental\nverification of this effect may be possible. The possibility of using this\neffect to probe the interior of matter, e.g., to determine the electrical\nconductivity of a rod by means of electrons encircling it is discussed.\n(Presented at the Conference on Fundamental Problems in Quantum Theory,\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County, June 18-22, 1994.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 1994 20:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-15"}
