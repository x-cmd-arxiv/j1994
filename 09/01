The underlying theme of the lectures is the search for\nhigher dimensional generalizations of the most basic facts about linear series\non curves.

Our\nprevious work in modeling the sentence processor resulted in a model in which\ndifferent processing modules used separate knowledge sources but operated in\nparallel to arrive at the interpretation of a sentence. One highlight of this\nmodel is that it offered an explanation of how the sentence processor might\nrecover from an error in choosing the meaning of an ambiguous word. Recent\nexperimental work by Laurie Stowe strongly suggests that the human sentence\nprocessor deals with syntactic error recovery using a mechanism very much like\nthat proposed by our model of semantic error recovery. Another way to interpret\nStowe's finding is this: the human sentence processor consists of a single\nunified processing module utilizing multiple independent knowledge sources in\nparallel. A sentence processor built upon this architecture should at times\nexhibit behavior associated with modular approaches, and at other times act\nlike an integrated system.

The comoving\ncoordinates of the dust particles and the proper time along the dust worldlines\nbecome canonical coordinates in the phase space of the system. The Hamiltonian\nconstraint can be resolved with respect to the momentum that is canonically\nconjugate to the dust time. Imposition of the resolved constraint as an\noperator restriction on the quantum states yields a functional Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. The ensuing Hamiltonian density has an extraordinary feature: it\ndepends only on the geometric variables, not on the dust coordinates or time.\nThis has three important consequences. First, the functional Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation can be solved by separating the dust time from the geometric\nvariables. Second, the Hamiltonian densities strongly commute and therefore can\nbe simultaneously defined by spectral analysis. Third, the standard constraint\nsystem of vacuum gravity is cast into a form in which it generates a true Lie\nalgebra. The particles of dust introduce into space a privileged system of\ncoordinates that allows the supermomentum constraint to be solved explicitly.\nThe Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation yields a conserved inner product that can be\nwritten in terms of either the instantaneous state functionals or the solutions\nof constraints. Examples of gravitational observables are given, though neither\nthe intrinsic metric nor the extrinsic curvature are observables. Disregarding\nfactor--ordering difficulties, the introduction of dust provides a satisfactory\nphenomenological approach to the problem of time in canonical quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 1994 14:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}
