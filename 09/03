This paper introduces a four-dimensional notion of the information\navailable about a quantum system's boundary conditions in the various sets of\ndecohering histories it may display. The idea of spacetime information is\napplied in several contexts: When spacetime geometry is fixed the information\navailable through alternatives restricted to a spacetime region is defined.

In such theories complete information about\na quantum system is not necessarily available on any spacelike surface but must\nbe searched for throughout spacetime.

Starting with a Lagrangian built of Dirac\nspinors, orthonormal tetrads, and a complex rather than a real linear\nconnection we define an extended spinor derivative by which we obtain not only\na very natural unification, but can also fully clarify the nontrivial\nunderlying fibre bundle structure. Thereby a new type of contact interaction\nbetween spinors emerges, which differs from the usual one in Einstein--Cartan\ntheory. The splitting of the linear connection into a metric and an\nelectromagnetic part together with a characteristic length scale in the theory\nstrongly suggest that gravity and electromagnetism have the same geometrical\norigin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 1994 09:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
