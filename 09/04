String theory constraints form, in\ngeneral, a non-linear quasi(super)conformal algebra, and can have conformal\ndimensions $\\geq 1$. When $N=4$, the most general $N=4$ quasi-superconformal\nalgebra to consider for string theory building is $\\hat{D}(1,2;\\a)$, whose\nlinearisation is the so-called `large' $N=4$ superconformal algebra. The\n$\\hat{D}(1,2;\\a)$ algebra has $\\Hat{su(2)}_{k^+}\\oplus\n\\Hat{su(2)}_{k^-}\\oplus\\Hat{u(1)}$ Ka\\v{c}-Moody component, and $\\a=k^-/k^+$.\nWe check the Jacobi identities and construct a BRST charge for the\n$\\hat{D}(1,2;\\a)$ algebra. The quantum BRST operator can be made nilpotent only\nwhen $k^+=k^-=-2$. The $\\hat{D}(1,2;1)$ algebra is actually isomorphic to the\n$SO(4)$-based Bershadsky-Knizhnik non-linear quasi-superconformal algebra. We\nargue about the existence of a string theory associated with the latter, and\npropose the (non-covariant) hamiltonian action for this new $N=4$ string\ntheory. Our results imply the existence of two different $N=4$ fermionic string\ntheories: the old one based on the `small' linear $N=4$ superconformal algebra\nand having the total ghost central charge $c_{\\rm gh}=+12$, and the new one\nwith non-linearly realised $N=4$ supersymmetry, based on the $SO(4)$\nquasi-superconformal algebra and having $c_{\\rm gh}=+6$. Both critical string\ntheories have negative `critical dimensions' and do not admit unitary matter\nrepresentations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 1994 16:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}
