By performing the\nnumerical analysis of the free energy and the Euler-Lagrange equation we show\nthat the phase diagram is more complex. It also contains a set of metastable\nsolutions present in the range of coexistence of homogeneous and sinusoidal\nsolutions. These new configurations are periodic patterns of homogeneous\ndomains connected by sinusoidal segments. They are Lyapunov unstable, very\nprobably due to the nonintegrability of the free energy functional. We also\ndiscuss some other mathematical aspects of the model, and compare it with the\nessentially simpler sine-Gordon model for the transitions to the states with\nhigher commensurabilities.
