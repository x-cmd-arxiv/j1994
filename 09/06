For this, three different measures are used. We\nuse Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the errors in the methods. The\ncorrected distribution of cluster ellipticities shows a peak at $ \\epsilon \\sim\n0.4 $ and extends to $ \\epsilon \\sim 0.8 $. The results are self-consistent,\ni.e., with the corrected distribution over projected cluster shapes we can\nreconstruct the observed distribution and the observed relation between the\nnumber of galaxies in a cluster and its ellipticity. It is shown that the\nricher clusters are intrinsically more nearly spherical than the poorer ones.\nThe corrected distribution of cluster shapes is more consistent with a prolate\npopulation than with an oblate population.\n  We compare the corrected true distribution of (projected) ellipticities with\npredictions from N-body simulations. For this, we use a catalogue of 75 N-body\nsimulated clusters (van Kampen 1994) which assume a CDM spectrum with $ \\Omega\n= 1.0 $. The simulations include a recipe for galaxy formation and merging.\n'Observing' these simulated clusters produces an ellipticity distribution that\nextends to much higher $ \\epsilon $ and that has too few nearly spherical\nclusters. Preliminary results of simulations of the formation of clusters in an\n$ \\Omega = 0.2 $ universe suggest that, on average, clusters are more nearly\nspherical in this case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 1994 06:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

It is shown that the Schr\\\"odinger equation for\nthis generalized Kepler-Coulomb system can be separated in prolate spheroidal\ncoordinates. The coefficients of the interbasis expansions between three bases\n(spherical, parabolic and spheroidal) are studied in detail. It is found that\nthe coefficients for the expansion of the parabolic basis in terms of the\nspherical basis, and vice-versa, can be expressed through the Clebsch-Gordan\ncoefficients for the group SU(2) analytically continued to real values of their\narguments. The coefficients for the expansions of the spheroidal basis in terms\nof the spherical and parabolic bases are proved to satisfy three-term recursion\nrelations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 1994 18:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
