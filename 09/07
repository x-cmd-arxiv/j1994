When $p$ is positive all $n$\nof the edge modes are expected to move in the same direction, whereas for\nnegative $p$ one mode moves in a direction opposite to the other $n-1$ modes.\nUsing a chiral-Luttinger model to describe the edge channels, we show that for\nan ideal edge when $p$ is negative, a non-quantized and non-universal Hall\nconductance is predicted. The non-quantized conductance is associated with an\nabsence of equilibration between the $n$ edge channels.
