This set of equations describes a one\ndimensional cascade of energy towards higher wave vectors. When the model is\nchaotic, the high-wave-vector velocity is a product of roughly independent\nmultipliers, one for each logarithmic momentum shell. The appropriate tool for\nstudying the multifractal properties of this model is shown to be the energy\ncurrent on each shell rather than the velocity on each shell. Using this\nquantity, one can obtain better measurements of the deviations from Kolmogorov\nscaling (in the GOY dynamics) than were available up to now. These deviations\nare seen to depend upon the details of inertial-range structure of the model\nand hence are {\\em not} universal. However, once the conserved quantities of\nthe model are fixed to have the same scaling structure as energy and helicity,\nthese deviations seem to depend only weakly upon the scale parameter of the\nmodel. We analyze the connection between multifractality in the velocity\ndistribution and multifractality in the dissipation.
