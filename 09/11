Using Jaynes' maximum entropy formalism and\nEuclidean path integral evaluation of partition function, it is argued that in\nthe semiclassical limit when the fluctutation of metric is neglected, the black\nhole entropy of a Schwarzchild black hole is equal to the maximal information\nentropy of an observer whose sole knowledge of the black hole is its mass.\nBlack hole entropy becomes a measure of number of its internal mass eigenstates\nin accordance with the Boltzmann principle only in the limit of negligible\nrelative mass fluctutation. {}From the information theoretic perspective, the\nexample of a Schwarzchild black hole seems to suggest that black hole entropy\nis no different from ordinary thermodynamic entropy. It is a property of the\nexperimental data of a black hole, rather than being an intrinsic physical\nproperty of a black hole itself independent of any observer. However, it is\nstill weakly objective in the sense that different observers given the same set\nof data of a black hole will measure the same maximal information entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 1994 16:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Preferred deformations (by star\nproducts and unchanged coproducts) of Hopf algebras of functions on compact\ngroups and their duals, are of special interest.
