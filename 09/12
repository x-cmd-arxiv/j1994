The bar model is a self-consistent dynamical model built out of\nindividual orbits that has been populated to be consistent with the COBE maps\nof the Galaxy and kinematic observations of the Bulge. We find most of the\nlenses are at 6.25 kpc in BW. The microlensing optical depth of a 2E10 Msun bar\nplus a truncated disk is (2.2+-0.3)E-6, consistent with the very large optical\ndepth (3.2+-1.2)E-6 found by Udalski et al. (1994). This prediction doubles\nthat of axisymmetric models by Kiraga and Paczynski (1994) since the bar is\nelongated along the line-of-sight. The large Einstein radius and small\ntransverse velocity dispersion also predict a longer event duration in the bar\nmodel than the KP model. The event rate and duration distribution also depend\non the lower mass cutoff of the lens mass function. With a 0.1Msun cutoff, 5-7\nevents of typical 20 days duration are expected for the OGLE experiment\naccording to our model, while Udalski et al. observed 9 events with durations\nfrom 8-62 days. On the other hand, if most of the lenses are brown dwarfs, our\nmodel predicts too many short duration events; a KS test finds only 7%\nprobability for the model with 0.01Msun cutoff to be consistent with current\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 1994 19:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 1999 15:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
