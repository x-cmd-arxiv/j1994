The slowness of traditional\nalgorithms is overcome by updates on various length scales. In this article we\ndiscuss generalizations of multigrid methods for disordered systems, in\nparticular for propagators in lattice gauge theories. A discretized nonabelian\ngauge theory can be formulated as a system of statistical mechanics where the\ngauge field degrees of freedom are $SU(N)$ matrices on the links of the\nlattice. These $SU(N)$ matrices appear as random coefficients in Dirac\nequations. We aim at finding an efficient method by which one can solve Dirac\nequations without critical slowing down. If this could be achieved, Monte Carlo\nsimulations of Quantum Chromodynamics (the theory of the strong interaction)\nwould be accelerated considerably. In principle, however, the methods discussed\ncan be used in arbitrary space-time dimension and for arbitrary gauge group.\nMoreover, there are applications in multigrid Monte Carlo simulations, and for\nthe definition of block spins and blocked gauge fields in Monte Carlo\nrenormalization group studies. As a central results it was found that {\\em the\ngeometric multigrid method works in principle in arbitrarily disordered gauge\nfields.} Finally, an overview is given of other approaches to the propagator\nproblem in lattice gauge theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 1994 10:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-15"}
