With the Schwinger\nproper-time representation, and the spinor helicity technique, it has been\nshown that field theories can indeed be written in a string-like manner, thus\nresulting in simplifications in practical calculations, and providing novel\ninsights into gauge and gravitational theories. This paper continues the study\nof string organization of field theories by focusing on the question of local\nduality. It is shown that a single expression for the sum of many diagrams can\nindeed be written for QED, thereby simulating the duality property in strings.\nThe relation between a single diagram and the dual sum is somewhat analogous to\nthe relation between a old- fashioned perturbation diagram and a Feynman\ndiagram.
