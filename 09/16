We find that close cluster pairs, with separation r<10Mpc/h,\nexhibit strong attractive peculiar velocities in all models; the cluster\npairwise velocities depend sensitively on the model. The mean pairwise\nattractive velocity of clusters on 5Mpc/h scale ranges from 1700 km/s for\nOmega=1 CDM, to 1000 km/s for PBI, to 700 km/s for Omega=0.3 CDM. The\nsmall-scale pairwise velocities depend also on cluster mass: richer, more\nmassive clusters exhibit stronger attractive velocities than less massive\nclusters. On large scales, from 20 to 200Mpc/h, the cluster peculiar velocities\nare increasingly dominated by bulk and random motions; they are independent of\ncluster mass. The cluster velocity correlation function, which reflects the\nbulk motion minus the relative motion of pairs, is negative on small scales for\nOmega=1 and Omega=0.3 CDM, and positive for PBI; this indicates stronger\npairwise motion than bulk motion on small scales for CDM, and relatively larger\nbulk motions for PBI. The cluster velocity correlation function is positive on\nvery large scales, from 10 to 200Mpc/h, for all models. These positive\ncorrelations, which decrease monotonically with scale, indicate significant\nbulk motions of clusters up to 200Mpc/h. The strong dependence of the cluster\nvelocity functions on models, especially at small separations, makes them\nuseful tools in constraining cosmological models when compared with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 1994 20:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

For each integer $k$ we ask\nfor $N_k^{n,r}$, the number of {\\em ordered\\/} pairs of these walks that\nintersect in exactly $k$ points. The number of points in the intersection of\ntwo such walks is defined as the cardinality of the intersection of their two\nsets of vertices, excluding the initial and terminal vertices. We find two\nexplicit formulas for the numbers $N_k^{n,r}$. Next we note that $N_1^{n,r}= 2\nN_0^{n,r}$, i.e., that {\\em exactly twice as many pairs of walks have a single\nintersection as have no intersection\\/}. Such a relationship clearly merits a\nbijective proof, and we supply one. We discuss a number of related results for\ndifferent assumptions on the two walks. We find the probability that two\nindependent walkers on a given lattice rectangle do not meet. In this\nsituation, the walkers start at the two points $(a,b+x+1)$ and (a+x+1,b)$ in\nthe first quadrant, and walk West or South at each step, except that when a\nwalker reaches the $x$-axis (resp. the $y$-axis) then all future steps are\nconstrained to be South (resp. West) until the origin is reached. We find that\nif the probability $p(i,j)$ that a step from $(i,j)$ will go West depends only\non $i+j$, then the probabilty that the two walkers do not meet until they reach\nthe origin is the same as the probability that a single (unconstrained) walker\nwho starts at $(a, b+x+1)$ and and takes $a+b+x$ steps, finishes at one of the\npoints $(0,1), (-1,2), \\ldots, (-x,1+x)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 1994 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

Theorem: i(d) =<\n(d-1) {2d-1 choose d} + 1. The proof of this result leads to the following\ncovering problem on graphs: Let G be a graph. A family H is subset of (2^{V(G)}\nis an edge cover of G iff for every edge e of G, there is an E belongs to\nH(edge set) which includes e.

Theorem: There is an edge e belongs to E such that |{U belongs\nto F | e belongs to U}| =< 1/2|F|. This is equivalent to the following\nassertion: If H is a union-closed family generated by a family of sets of\nmaximum degree two, then there is an $x$ such that |{U belongs to H | x belongs\nto U}| > 1/2|H|. This is a special case of the union-closed sets conjecture. To\nput this result in perspective, a brief overview of research on the\nunion-closed sets conjecture is given. A proof of a strong version of the\ntheorem on graph-generated families of sets is presented. This proof depends on\nan analysis of the local properties of F and an application of Kleitman's\nlemma.

These\nconsiderations for designing symmetric and directed interconnection networks\nare well justified in practice and have been widely recognized in the research\ncommunity. Among the important properties of a good network, efficient routing\nis probably one of the most important. In this paper, we further study routing\nschemes in the cycle prefix network. We confirm an observation first made from\ncomputer experiments regarding the diameter change when certain links are\nremoved in the original network, and we completely determine the wide diameter\nof the network. The wide diameter of a network is now perceived to be even more\nimportant than the diameter. We show by construction that the wide diameter of\nthe cycle prefix network is very close to the ordinary diameter. This means\nthat routing in parallel in this network costs little extra time compared to\nordinary single path routing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 1994 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
