Three of the most convincing associations are\nradio-bright, nearby shell remnants and a fourth is associated with a plerion.\n  We examine possible gamma-ray production mechanisms and conclude that pion\nproduction and decay from high-energy protons interacting with the remnant gas\ncould produce the gamma rays.\n  The energetics of this process are in accord with theories of cosmic ray\nproduction through supernova shock acceleration.\n  The identification of pion-decay features in the gamma-ray spectra of\nsupernova remnants would support this interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 1994 21:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
