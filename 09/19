It is shown here that sound waves\ncan propagate through shocks in one direction and that this is a sufficient\ncondition for the sound wave pressure mechanism to work. A strong shock\namplifies a sound wave passing through it and can drag the sound wave away from\nthe star. It is immaterial for the sound wave pressure gradient that the sound\nwave vector points towards the star. Since the strong shocks drag the sound\nwaves away, the star itself is the source for the sound waves propagating\ntowards it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 1994 14:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is\nshown that the expressions not only of the excitation energy but also of the\nelectromagnetic transition rate in the microscopic RPA framework can be cast\ninto the corresponding forms of the macroscopic rotor model. Criteria to\nidentify the rotational band associated with the wobbling motion are given,\nbased on which examples of realistic calculations are investigated and some\ntheoretical predictions are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 1994 05:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
