The aim is to understand the\nqualitative effects of internal and external irregularities associated, e.g.,\nwith discreteness effects or couplings to an external environment, which stars\nin any real galaxy must experience. The two principal conclusions are: (1)\nThese irregularities can be important on time scales much shorter than the\nnatural relaxation time scale t_R associated with the friction and noise. For\nstochastic orbits friction and noise induce an average exponential divergence\nfrom the unperturbed Hamiltonian trajectory at a rate set by the value of the\nlocal Lyapunov exponent. Even weak noise can make a pointwise interpretation of\norbits suspect already on time scales much shorter than t_R. (2) The friction\nand noise can also have significant effects on the statistical properties of\nensembles of stochastic orbits, these also occurring on time scales much\nshorter than t_R. Potential implications for galactic dynamics are discussed,\nincluding the problem of shadowing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 1994 21:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Methods of $b$ ``flavor tagging\" are broadly divided into\n``opposite $b$\" tagging and self-tagging of the signal $b$ hadron. The former,\nwhile understood, has the perceived drawback of low efficiency. The latter,\nwhile having the potential for an order of magnitude higher efficiency, has yet\nto be demonstrated for neutral $B$ hadrons. In this article we review opposite\n$b$ tagging in light of methods whose efficacy has only recently been\ndemonstrated or suggested. In addition, we recommend a number of tagging\nmethods for the opposite $b$ including: $K^{*0}$ and $K^{*\\pm}$ with large\ninclusive yields of 15\\% and 18\\%; $\\overline \\Lambda$ and $\\overline\n{\\Lambda}p $; partially reconstructed charmed hadrons; sophisticated jet charge\ntechniques, etc. We also recommend the use of self-tagging for the $opposite$\n$b$ hadron. Such an inversion of self-tagging could conceivably increase the\nefficiency of opposite $b$ tagging and even mitigate the effects of neutral $B$\nmixing. Self-tagging of the signal hadron, when possible, could be used either\nby itself or to confirm the result from the opposite $b$ tag. We suggest that\nall methods be weighted by their dilutions and combined to yield efficient\ntagging. For a given detector, this requires that the dilution of each tag be\nwell measured. We therefore review the determination of the dilution $D_T$ for\na general tag $T$ in some detail. Finally, we briefly consider $B$ sector and\nsuggest a number of exclusive modes which can be combined for higher statistics\nprobes of the unitarity angles. While ambitious from an experimental\nperspective, the program of flavor identification outlined here has the\npotential to yield important fundamental results in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 1994 23:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper we\nderive by a direct one-loop perturbative computation the $\\kappa$-anomaly\nassociated to the Yang-Mills Chern-Simons threeform and, for the first time,\nthe one associated to the Lorentz Chern-Simons threeform. Contrary to what is\noften stated in the literature we show that the Lorentz $\\kappa$-anomaly gets\ncontributions from the integration over both the fermionic {\\it and\\/} bosonic\ndegrees of freedom of the string. A careful analysis of the absolute\ncoefficients of all these anomalies reveals that they can be absorbed by\nsetting $dH={\\alpha'\\over4}(\\trace F^2-\\trace R^2)$, where $\\alpha'$ is the\nstring tension, the expected result. We show that this relation ensures also\nthe absence of gauge and Lorentz anomalies in the sigma-model effective action.\nWe evidenciate the presence of infrared divergences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 1994 17:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
