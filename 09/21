Combining the new data with that already obtained for\nthe proton by the EMC group and earlier SLAC/YALE collaborations, together with\nbounds obtained on the strange quark polarisation, we show that the Bjorken\nsystem of equations is violated at about the 2 sigma level. We also show, using\nunpolarised data, that arguments based on possible higher-twist contributions\nare unable to account for this discrepancy.

The problems considered\ninclude maximum independent set, minimum vertex cover, minimum coloring and\nminimum dominating set. We also present an on-line coloring heuristic which\nachieves a competitive ratio of 6 for unit disk graphs. Our heuristics do not\nneed a geometric representation of unit disk graphs. Geometric representations\nare used only in establishing the performance guarantees of the heuristics.\nSeveral of our approximation algorithms can be extended to intersection graphs\nof circles of arbitrary radii in the plane, intersection graphs of regular\npolygons, and to intersection graphs of higher dimensional regular objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 1994 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
