A combination of earlier redshift surveys with two new\nsurveys allows the first accurate determination of the evolution of the\nluminosity function with redshift, and reveals a marked steepening of the faint\nend slope. This effect is more profound for star-forming galaxies - there are\n5-10 times as many star-forming galaxies at z~0.5 as there are locally. These\nresults, together with high-resolution imaging and linewidth velocity\nmeasurements, support the view that the excess of star-forming galaxies at\nmoderate redshift represents a general increase in the star-formation rate of\nnormal galaxies rather than a distinct new population. This increase in\nstar-formation appears in lower-L galaxies at lower redshift and only appears\nin L* galaxies at z>0.5. Imaging studies provide indirect evidence which\nsuggests that interactions are responsible for a large part of this increased\nactivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 1994 22:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
