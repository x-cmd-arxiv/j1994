We do this by\nconsidering physical matrix elements with the operators inserted at non-zero\nmomentum. The resulting IR singularities are regulated dimensionally. We show\nthat the physical matrix element of the BRST exact gauge variant operator which\nappears in the energy- momentum tensor is zero. We then show that the physical\nmatrix elements of the classical energy-momentum tensor and the gauge invariant\ntwist two gluon operator are independent of the gauge fixing parameter. A\nSudakov factor appears in the latter cases. The universality of this factor and\nthe UV finiteness of the energy-momentum tensor provide another method of\nfinding the anomalous dimension of the gluon operator.

This basis defines a lattice phase space in which quadratic\nHamiltonians constructed from the observables induce site-to-site hopping at\ndiscrete time intervals. When recently suggested communication\nschemes\\cite{BENa} are adapted to the lattice they are greatly enhanced,\nbecause the finite Heisenberg group structure allows dynamic generation of\nsignal sequences using the quadratic Hamiltonians.
