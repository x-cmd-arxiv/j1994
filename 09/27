The proposed strategy should therefore be adopted even before a\nparallax satellite is launched.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 1994 21:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

In addition to a CKM phase, neutral boson mixing, and superweak\neffects, there can be significant CP violation due to charged Higgs boson\nexchange. The value of $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ due to this last effect could be as\nlarge as in the standard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 1994 10:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}
