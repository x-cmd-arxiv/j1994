For each model we\ncompute the local LF, HI mass function, number counts, redshift and color\ndistributions.

The colors and redshift distributions\nremain roughly consistent with observations to B=24.

The general- relativistic\nequations for static, spherically symmetric stellar structure are specialized\nto treat the self-gravitational effects of static, spheri- cally symmetric,\nnonnegative, localized energy densities which may exhibit nonintegrable\nsingularities at zero radius. It is demonstrated that in many situations,\nincluding the electromagnetic ones of interest here, such a system has a black\nhole whose Schwarzschild radius is that where the original energy per radial\ndistance (the spherical shell area times the original energy density) reaches\nthe inverse of (2G). The total mass of the system is that of this black hole\n(which follows in the usual way from its Schwarz- schild radius) plus the\nintegrated original energy density outside this black hole. These results\nproduce, for the classical point-charge model of the electron, an electrostatic\ncontribution to its mass which is many orders of magnitude larger than its\nmeasured mass.
