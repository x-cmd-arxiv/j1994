The appropriate instanton\nis twisted on a four-torus and has instanton number equal to one half. It\ngenerates a Skyrme field with the correct topological and symmetry properties\nof the crystal. An explicit solution for the instanton is not known, but an\nanalytical fit to numerical data is available and using this we obtain a Skyrme\ncrystal whose energy is only 2 percent above that of the (numerically) known\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 1994 14:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
