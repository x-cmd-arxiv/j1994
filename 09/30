An understanding of the Lyalpha\nabsorbers seen in QSO spectra is an important part of this program since such\nabsorbers can be traced back to very high redshifts. Their mere existence\nplaces constraints on the physical state of the intergalactic medium. The\ndiscovery of Lyalpha absorbers at low redshift allows us to estimate for the\nfirst time what fraction of low redshift Lyalpha absorbers are (i) randomly\ndistributed, (ii) distributed like galaxies but not physically associated with\nluminous objects, (iii) actually part of the halos of luminous galaxies, or\n(iv) tidal tails within galaxy groups. Results from the sightline to the QSO\n3C273 suggest that the majority of the absorbers are not associated with\ngalaxies, but that there is a significant subset that are. The absorbers\nassociated with galaxies may be produced in enormous gaseous disks surrounding\nnormal spiral galaxies, or may be tidal material bound up in small groups of\ngalaxies\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 1994 16:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Such a collapse\nis described by the Tolman-Bondi metric which has two free functions: the\n`mass-function' and the `energy function', which are determined by the initial\ndensity and velocity profile of the cloud. The collapse can end in a black-hole\nor a naked singularity, depending on the initial parameters characterizing\nthese profiles. In the marginally bound case, we find that the collapse ends in\na naked singularity if the leading non-vanishing derivative of the density at\nthe center is either the first one or the second one. If the first two\nderivatives are zero, and the third derivative non-zero, the singularity could\neither be naked or covered, depending on a quantity determined by the third\nderivative and the central density. If the first three derivatives are zero,\nthe collapse ends in a black hole. In particular, the classic result of\nOppenheimer and Snyder, that homogeneous dust collapse leads to a black hole,\nis recovered as a special case. Analogous results are found when the cloud is\nnot marginally bound, and also for the case of a cloud starting from rest. We\nalso show how the strength of the naked singularity depends on the density and\nvelocity distribution. Our analysis generalizes and simplifies the earlier work\nof Christodoulou and Newman [4,5] by dropping the assumption of evenness of\ndensity functions. It turns out that relaxing this assumption allows for a\nsmooth transition from the naked singularity phase to the black-hole phase, and\nalso allows for the occurrence of strong curvature naked singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 1994 10:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
