FeI emission, if present, will help\nreveal the physical conditions of the emitting gas. In an attempt to verify the\npresence of FeI lines, high S/N spectra of two FeII-strong quasars, IRAS\n07598-6508 and PHL 1092, were obtained at the Multiple Mirror Telescope and the\nSteward 2.3 m Telescope. We have identified emission lines of FeI and TiII. The\nsource of energy for FeII, FeI and TiII emission is probably not from\nionization by the photon continuum, but heat. The high rate of energy\ngeneration and the presence of both high and low velocity gas indicate that the\nheat is generated not over a large area, but a narrow band in accretion disk,\nin which the rotational speed decreases rapidly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 1994 17:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
