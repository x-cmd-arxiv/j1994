We use the recently proposed\nWarburton-Becker-Brown shell-model interaction. For the weak forces we discuss\ncomparatively different weak interaction models based on different assumptions\nfor evaluating the weak meson-hadron coupling constants. The results determine\na range of $P_{\\gamma}$ values from which we find the most probable values:\n$P_{\\gamma}$ = $1.1 \\cdot 10^{-4}$ for $^{36}Cl$ and $P_{\\gamma}$ = $3.5 \\cdot\n10^{-4}$ for $^{36}Ar$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 1994 15:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
