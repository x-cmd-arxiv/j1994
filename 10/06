A weighted intensity distribution which is derived\noverwhelmingly from pixels close to the continuum level in the Ly alpha forest\nregion is constructed by the evaluation of how closely correlated each pixel is\nwith its neighboring pixels.

Most models of the high state imply that the bulk of\nthe emission comes from an optically thick accretion disc; therefore, this\nstate may be an excellent laboratory for testing our ideas about the physics of\naccretion discs. In this work we consider the implications of assuming that\naccretion disc viscosity arises from some form of turbulence.
