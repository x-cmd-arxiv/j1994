After adding\ndark mass components, such as a central black hole, the two-integral distribu-\ntion function (2I-DF) f(E,Lz), which depends only on the classical integrals of\nmotion in an axisymmetric potential, is constructed using the Richardson- Lucy\nalgorithm.

Many discrepancies may be remedied by altering the assumed\ninclination angle, mass-to-light ratio, dark components, and odd part of the\n2I-DF.

In these\nmodels, the scalar develops a vacuum expectation value when the technifermions\ncondense, and the ordinary fermions develop masses via Yukawa couplings. Since\nthe symmetry breaking sector involves both a fundamental scalar doublet and an\nisotriplet of composite scalars (the technipions), the phenomenology associated\nwith the charged scalars is similar to that found in a type-I two-Higgs doublet\nmodel. We show that the correction to the $Zb\\overline{b}$ vertex is small over\nthe allowed parameter space of the model in the two limits that we consider,\nand that there can be large, potentially observable, contributions to the\n$b\\rightarrow s \\gamma$ branching fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 1994 21:13:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 1994 00:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
