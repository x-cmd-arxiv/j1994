Overdense regions, with masses above the local\nbaryon-Jeans mass, are expected to collapse and form condensed objects.\nSurviving nucleosynthesis products therefore tend to originate from underdense\nregions. We compute expected surviving light element ($^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He,\n$^7$Li) abundance yields for a variety of stochastic fluctuation spectra. In\ngeneral, we find that spectra with significant power in fluctuations on length\nscales below that of the local baryon Jeans mass produce nucleosynthesis yields\nwhich are in conflict with observationally inferred primordial abundances.\nHowever, when this small scale structure is absent or suppressed, and the\ncollapse efficiency of overdense regions is high, there exists a range of\nfluctuation spectral characteristics which meet all primordial abundance\nconstraints. In such models abundance constraints can be met even when the\npre-collapse baryonic fraction of the closure density is $\\Omega_b\\approx\n0.2h^{-2}$($h$ is the Hubble parameter in units of 100 km\\ s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$).\nNucleosynthesis in these models is characterized by high $^2$H/H and low $^4$He\nmass fraction relative to a homogeneous big bang at a given value of\n$\\Omega_bh^2$. A potentially observable signature of these models is the\nproduction of intrinsic primordial abundance variations on baryon mass-scales\nup to $10^{10}M_{\\odot}-10^{12}_{\\odot}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 1994 17:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The simplest tree describes the landscape\nof a random energy model, whereas multifurcating trees occur in the solution of\nthe Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. An important ingredient taken from these\nmodels is the exponential distribution of deep free-energies, which translate\ninto a power-law distribution of the residence time within metastable\n`valleys'. These power law distributions have infinite mean in the spin-glass\nphase and this leads to the aging phenomenon. To each level of the tree are\nassociated an overlap and the exponent of the time distribution. We solve these\nmodels for a finite (but arbitrary) number of levels and show that a two level\ntree accounts very well for many experimental observations (thermoremanent\nmagnetisation, a.c susceptibility, second noise spectrum....). We introduce the\nidea that the deepest levels of the tree correspond to equilibrium dynamics\nwhereas the upper levels correspond to aging. Temperature cycling experiments\nsuggest that the borderline between the two is temperature dependent. The\nspin-glass transition corresponds to the temperature at which the uppermost\nlevel is put out of equilibrium but is subsequently followed by a sequence of\n(dynamical) phase transitions corresponding to non equilibrium dynamics within\ndeeper and deeper levels. We tentatively try to relate this `tree' picture to\nthe real space `droplet' model, and speculate on how the final description of\nspin-glasses might look like.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 1994 19:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
