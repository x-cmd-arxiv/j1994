It is shown that radiative\ncorrections can simulate a pion polarizability effect. The average effect was\nestimated for pion energies 40-600 GeV. We also study the range of\napplicability of the equivalent photon approximation in describing one-photon\nradiative emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 1994 13:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2008 21:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
