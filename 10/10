Revision: recent experimental results the prediction\n  of neutrino masses","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"hep-th","license":null,"abstract":"  This paper belongs to a series devoted to the calculation of particle masses\nin p-adic conformal field theory limit of TGD. In paper III elementary particle\nmasses were calculated. In this paper the results are analyzed. One can\nreproduce lepton and gauge boson masses exactly by taking into account Coulomb\nself energy associated with the interior of 3-surface and a small mixing of\nboundary topologies of charged leptons. Hadronic mass formula in- volves\nboundary contributions of quarks calculated previously plus interior term\nconsisting isospin-isopin, color magnetic spin-spin and color Coulombic terms.\nOne must take also into account mixing of boundary topologies, the mixing for\nprimary condensate levels (quark spends part of time at lower condensate level)\nand mixing of I=0,J=0 mesons. Topological mixing implies the nontriviality of\nCKM matrix. An open question is how uniquely rationality require- ment fixes\nCKM matrix. It is possible to reproduce CKM matrix sa- tisfying the empirical\nconstraints. CP breaking is a number theo- retical necessity. The large mixing\nof u and c quarks solves the spin crisis of proton. The parameters associated\nwith other O(p) contributions can be fixed by no Planck mass condition plus\nsome empirical inputs. O(p^2) contributions are also discu- ssed and observed\nisospin splittings can be reproduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 1994 12:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 1994 09:47:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 1995 08:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Leptons and U type quarks are\npredicted to have light colored excitations. The anomalous production of e^+e^-\npairs in heavy ion collisions sup- ports the existence of light leptomeson but\nthere are objections against light exotics. a) Asymptotic freedom in the\nstandard sense might be lost: the recently identified exotic color bosons\nhowever save the situation. b) Z^0 decay width seems to exclude light exotics.\nThe solution of the problem relies on p-adic probability concept. The real\ncounterpart (\\sum_jP(ito j))_R for the sum of p-adic probabi- lities differs\nfrom the sum \\sum_j P(i toj)_R for the real counter- parts of p-adic\nprobabilities. Interpretation:(\\sum_jP(i to j))_R is used, when only a common\nsignature for final states is used. \\sum_j(P(i to j)_R is used, when each final\nstate is monitored separately. The total decay rate of $Z^0$ to unmonitored\nexotic leptons is sensitive to the value of \\theta_W(eff) and vanishes for\nsin^2(\\theta_W(eff))=0.2324 and sensible value of \\alpha_s(L)! In TGD the\nobserved top quark candidate most probably corresponds to u and d quarks of\nM_{89} hadron physics. The details of the identification and signatures of the\nnew Physics are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 1994 12:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 1994 09:50:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 1995 08:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

These\nself-dual models have one realization with nonrelativistic dynamics for the\nscalar fields, and another with relativistic dynamics for the scalars. In each\nmodel, the energy density may be minimized by a Bogomol'nyi bound which is\nsaturated by solutions to a set of first-order self-duality equations. In the\nnonrelativistic case the self-dual potential is quartic, the system possesses a\ndynamical conformal symmetry, and the self-dual solutions are equivalent to the\nstatic zero energy solutions of the equations of motion. The nonrelativistic\nself-duality equations are integrable and all finite charge solutions may be\nfound. In the relativistic case the self-dual potential is sixth order and the\nself-dual Lagrangian may be embedded in a model with an extended supersymmetry.\nThe self-dual potential has a rich structure of degenerate classical minima,\nand the vacuum masses generated by the Chern-Simons Higgs mechanism reflect the\nself-dual nature of the potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 1994 13:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
