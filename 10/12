It is argued that the relevant large-scale physics of the model is\npreserved by projection of the quantum Hamiltonian on its sector of degenerate\nstrong-coupling ground states. For values of the Hall conductivity close to\ne^2/2h (mod e^2/h), where a delocalization transition occurs, this yields the\nHamiltonian of a quantum superspin chain which is closely related to an\nanisotropic version of the Chalker-Coddington model.

As a prototype the particle in a\nperiodic potential is discussed: a unique ground state is shown to exist as a\nstate on the Weyl algebra, and a functional measure (spectral stochastic\nprocess) is constructed on trajectories taking values in the spectrum of the\nmaximal abelian subalgebra of the Weyl algebra isomorphic to the algebra of\nalmost periodic functions. The thermodynamical limit of the finite volume\nfunctional integrals for such models is discussed, and the superselection\nsectors associated to an observable subalgebra of the Weyl algebra are\ndescribed in terms of boundary conditions and/or topological terms in the\nfinite volume measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 1994 14:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Each shape is a well-defined polytope, derived from the Delaunay\ntriangulation of the point set, with a parameter $\\alpha \\in \\Real$ controlling\nthe desired level of detail. An algorithm is presented that constructs the\nentire family of shapes for a given set of size $n$ in time $O(n^2)$, worst\ncase.
