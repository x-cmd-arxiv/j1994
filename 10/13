The relaxation towards the new equilibrium takes a\nfinite time, so the matter is not quite in chemical equilibrium, and energy is\nstored that can be released by reactions. For a neutron star core composed of\nneutrons (n), protons (p), and electrons (e), the departure from chemical\nequilibrium is quantified by the chemical potential difference $\\delta\\mu\\equiv\n\\mu_{\\rm p}+\\mu_{\\rm e} -\\mu_{\\rm n}$.

The solutions of these equations are the pairing\nvibrations in (A${\\underline{+}}$2) nuclei. For the $0^+_1$ and $0^+_2$ states\nof the nucleus $^{208}$Pb, the variations of relative energies and transfer\ncross-sections for populating these states via (t,p) reaction, with deformation\nparameter $\\tau$ have been analysed. For $\\tau=0.405$ the experimental\nexcitation energy of 4.87MeV and the ratio $\\frac{\\sigma(0^+_2)\n}{\\sigma(0^+_1)}=0.45$ are well reproduced. The critical value of pairing\ninteraction strength for which phase transition takes place, is seen to be\nlower for deformed zero-coupled nucleon pair condensate with $\\tau$ real,\nsupporting our earlier conclusion that the real deformation simulates the\ntwo-body residual interaction. For $\\tau$ purely imaginary a stronger pairing\ninteraction is required to bring about the phase transition. The effect of\nimaginary deformation is akin to that of an antipairing type repulsive\ninteraction. Using deformed zero coupled quasi-particle pairs, a deformed\nversion of Quasi-boson approximation for $0^+$ states in superconducting nuclei\nis developed. For the test model of 20 particles in two shells, the results of\nq-deformed boson and quasi-boson approximations have been compared with exact\nresults. It is found that the deformation effectively takes into account the\nanharmonicities and may be taken as a quantitative measure of the correlations\nnot being accounted for in a certain approximate treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 1994 18:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
