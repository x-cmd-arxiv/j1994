Unlike PDE's, the\nmodel can be applied with minimal computational machinery, and few sources of\nnumerical error. Moreover, this model clarifies possible mechanisms by which\nvarious coherent solutions are maintained in the face of dispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 1994 21:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
