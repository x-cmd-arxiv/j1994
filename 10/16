It is shown that the ample cone admits a locally\nfinite chamber structure, and that passing a wall adjacent to a pair of\nchambers has the effect of modifying the moduli space by a (finite) sequence of\nflips of the type studied by Thaddeus. The key steps are a modification of\nSimpson's method and the introduction of a \"rationally twisted\" moduli space.\nThe result is more general but less explicit than the recent work of\nEllingsrud-Goettsche (alg-geom/9410005) and Friedman-Qin (alg-geom/9410007).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 1994 22:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The\nproblem lies in constructing representations of topological $^*$-algebras of\nquantum fields which are not normed. We restrict our consideration only to\nchronological forms on quantum field algebras. In this case, since\nchronological forms of boson fields are symmetric, the algebra of quantum\nfields can be replaced with the commutative tenzor algebra of the corresponding\ninfinite-dimensional nuclear space $\\Phi$. This is the enveloping algebra of\nthe abelian Lie group of translations in $\\Phi$. The generating functions of\nunitary representations of this group play the role of Euclidean generating\nfunctionals in algebraic QFT. They are the Fourier transforms of measures in\nthe dual $\\Phi'$ to the space $\\Phi$. By analogy with the case of boson fields,\nthe corresponding anticommutative algebra of fermion fields is defined to be\nthe algebra of functions taking their values into an infinite Grassman algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 1994 00:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
