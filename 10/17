We consider spatially flat,\nperturbed FRW models that begin with an inflationary phase, followed by a mixed\nphase containing both radiation and dust. The scale factor during the mixed\nphase takes the form $a(\\eta)=c_1\\eta^2+c_2\\eta+c_3$, where $c_i$ are\nconstants. During the mixed phase the universe smoothly transforms from being\nradiation to dust dominated. We find analytic expressions for the graviton mode\nfunction during the mixed phase in terms of spheroidal wave functions. This\nmode function is used to find an analytic expression for the multipole moments\n$\\langle a_l^2\\rangle$ of the two-point angular correlation function\n$C(\\gamma)$ for the CBR anisotropy. The analytic expression for the multipole\nmoments is written in terms of two integrals, which are evaluated numerically.\nThe results are compared to multipoles calculated for models that are {\\it\ncompletely} dust dominated at last-scattering. We find that the multipoles\n$\\langle a_l^2\\rangle$ of the CBR temperature perturbations for $l>10$ are\nsignificantly larger for a universe that contains both radiation and dust at\nlast-scattering. We compare our results with recent, similar numerical work and\nfind good agreement.

A syntax for formulas. 2.\nAn inference relation between sets of formulas. 3. A rule for assigning meaning\nto formulas (semantics) that is sound with respect to the inference relation.\n  First order logic, the logic and semantics of programming languages, and the\nlanguages that have been formulated for various kinds of categories are all\ncommonly described in this way. The formulas in those logics are strings of\nsymbols that are ultimately modeled on the sentences mathematicians speak and\nwrite when proving theorems.\n  Mathematicians with a categorial orientation frequently state and prove\ntheorems using graphs and diagrams. The theory of sketches provides a formal\nway to describe mathematical structures and impose requirements (such as\nequations) on them using graphs, diagrams and similar structures. The graphs,\ndiagrams and other data of a sketch are formal objects that correspond to the\ngraphs and diagrams used by such mathematicians in much the same way as the\nformulas of traditional logic correspond to the sentences mathematicians use in\nproofs.\n  Sketch theory has a well-known and well-developed functorial semantics\ncorresponding to item 3 in the description of logic above. The content of this\npaper is to propose a structure in sketch theory that corresponds to items 1\nand 2 in that description.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 1994 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
