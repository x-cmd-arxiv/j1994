The new\nfeature is that the random energy values are not assumed to be independent at\ndifferent sites but free. Freeness of random variables is an analogue of the\nconcept of independence for non-commuting random operators. A possible\nrealization is the ensemble of at different lattice-sites randomly rotated\nmatrices. The one- and two-particle Green functions of the proposed hamiltonian\nare calculated exactly. The eigenstates are extended and the conductivity is\nnonvanishing everywhere inside the band. The long-range behaviour and the\nzero-frequency limit of the two-particle Green function are universal with\nrespect to the eigenvalue distribution in the electronic level space.

We study here the cases\nwith $U(1)$ and $SO(3)$ global internal symmetries. The presence of a mass term\nbreaks the conformal invariance and allows for the longitudinal modes of the\nspin-1 field to be present in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. In the case of the\nU(1) global internal symmetry, we have only one single ``classical'' degree of\nfreedom while in the case of the SO(3) global symmetry, we are led to consider\na simple two-dimensional minisuperspace model. These minisuperspaces are shown\nto be equivalent to a set of coupled harmonic oscillators where the kinetic\nterm of the longitudinal modes has a coefficient proportional to the inverse of\nthe scale factor.
