Ground state and deformation properties are calculated using\nstatic Hartree-Fock, Hartree-Fock+BCS and constrained Hartree-Fock models.\nCollective properties, such as reaction rates and resonances, are described\nusing a new alternate method for evaluating linear response theory, which is\nconstructed directly on top of the static calculation. This provides a\nconsistent description of the ground state, deformation and collective nuclear\nproperties. Sample results are presented for the giant multiple resonances of\n$^{16}$O. }\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 1994 19:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
