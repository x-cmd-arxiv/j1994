This differs\nfrom earlier work involving Liapounov exponents by focusing on the statistical\nproperties of ensembles of trajectories, rather than individual orbits, and by\nrestricting attention to the properties of these ensembles over time scales\nshorter than the age of the Universe, t_H. For many potentials, generic\nensembles of initial conditions corresponding to stochastic orbits exhibit a\nrapid evolution towards an invariant measure $\\Gamma$, the natural unit to\nconsider if one is interested in self-consistent equilibria. The basic idea is\nto compute short time Liapounov exponents ${\\chi}(Dt)$ over time intervals $Dt$\nfor orbits in an ensemble that samples $\\Gamma$, and to analyse the overall\ndistribution of these ${\\chi}$'s. One finds that time averages and ensemble\naverages coincide, so that the form of the distribution of short time\n${\\chi}(Dt)$'s for such an ensemble is actually encoded in the calculation of\n${\\chi}(t)$ for a single orbit over long times $t>>t_{H}$. The distribution of\nshort time ${\\chi}$'s is analysed as a function of the energy E of orbits in\nthe ensemble and the length of the short time sampling interval ${\\D}t$. For\nrelatively high energies, the distribution is essentially Gaussian, the\ndispersion decreasing with time as $t^{-p}$, with an exponent 0<p<1/2 that\ndepends on the energy E.

A class of local,\ndeterministic discrete mathematical models with delayed determinism is\ndescribed that may be consistent with existing experiments. These are not\nhidden variables theories in the sense that they are not theories of particles\nplus hidden variables. They are theories of `hidden' distributed information\nstored holographic like throughout a space time region. This information cannot\nbe uniquely associated with individual particles although it determines the\nresults observed in particle interactions. The classical parameters of an\ninteraction are determined as {\\it focal points} of continuous nonlinear\nchanges in the wave function and not as discrete events. In addition to not\nviolating Bell's inequality this class of theories can in principle be\ndistinguished from standard quantum mechanics by other experiments. These\ndifferences and the experimental constraints on a test of Bell's inequality to\ndiscriminate between the existing theory and this class of models are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 1994 23:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 1995 23:43:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 1995 01:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
