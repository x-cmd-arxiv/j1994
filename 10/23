Over the last decade, much of the progress in this field\nhas been achieved through the study of transient X--ray binary sources which\nshine only sporadically in the X--ray sky and undergo much larger luminosity\nvariations then most persistent sources. There are currently six stellar--mass\nblack hole candidates for which the mass of the compact object is estimated to\nbe well above the maximum neutron star mass. The three most recently identified\nblack hole candidates of this kind belong to a class of transient X--ray\nsources with peculiar spectral properties. Several new transients of this class\nare being discovered and studied every year thanks to more continous monitoring\nof the X--ray sky. Many of them are likely to contain other black hole\ncandidates. The growing number of candidates and the large luminosity\nvariations (and therefore, accretion rate variations) in transient sources will\nallow to study the chacteristics of accreting black holes with an unprecedented\ndetail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 1994 12:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

Moreover,\nparity conservation can lead to a sum rule which relates weak form factors at\ndifferent kinematic points. {}From this sum rule, model independent lower\nbounds on Isgur--Wise form factors can be obtained analytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 1994 23:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
