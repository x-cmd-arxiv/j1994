The four dimensional theories give a coupling between a\nscalar field and an external divergenceless vector field and they may have some\napplication in magnetohydrodynamics. Like in conformal theories they possess a\ndiffeomorphism symmetry, which for us is along the direction of the vector\nfield, and their generators are analogous to Virasoro generators. Our analysis\nof the abelian Chern-Simons system uses elementary canonical methods for the\nquantization of field theories defined on manifolds with boundaries. Edge\nstates appear for these systems and they yield a four dimensional current\nalgebra. We examine the quantization of these algebras in several special cases\nand claim that a renormalization of the $5D$ Chern-Simons coupling is necessary\nfor removing divergences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 1994 01:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
