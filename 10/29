From this bound, it is shown\nthat the difference of expectation values also obeys AWEC and ANEC-type\nintegral conditions.

We\nshow that characteristic features of the observed dynamical moments of inertia\nare well accounted for by explicitly taking the octupole correlations into\naccount. Importance of the interplay between rotation and octupole vibrations\nis stressed, and it is suggested that one of the observed excited bands might\nbe a collective octupole vibration built on the superdeformed yrast band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 1994 16:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
