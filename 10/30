To\nthis end neutrino flavor evolution is described by nonlinear equations\nfollowing from a quantum kinetic approach. This takes into account neutrino\nforward scattering off the neutrino background itself. In contrast to other\nclaims in the literature it is shown that a sound self-consistent analytical\napproximation can in the first place only be performed in the adiabatic limit\nwhere phase terms are suppressed. In the cosmologically interesting mass range\nbelow about $25\\eV$ the resulting mixing parameter bounds are between one and\ntwo orders of magnitude less restrictive than limits neglecting neutrino\ncontributions. Extensions to the non-adiabatic regime derived in the literature\nusually neglect coherence effects from phases. To check their importance\nnumerical simulations of the evolution equations were performed in this regime.\nThey indicate that analytical approximations for the flavor conversion\nefficiencies can indeed be extended by neglecting phase terms. This allows more\nstringent bounds similar to the ones derived in earlier work. These bounds\ndepend to some extent on the adopted supernova model and tend to be somewhat\nless restrictive in the mixing angle but simultaneously extend to smaller\nmixing masses compared to limits neglecting the neutrino induced potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 1994 20:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We\napply these to high-resolution PM N-body simulations of structure formation in\nCHDM (cold/hot/baryon fractions=.6/.3/.1, b=1.5 (COBE norm) and two CDM models;\nb=1.5 and b=1.0 (COBE norm). Groups are identified with the Nolthenius (1993)\nalgorithm. We find: (1) Properties of groups are a powerful and robust\ndiscriminator between these Gaussian models whose spatial and velocity\nproperties differ on Mpc scales. We test robustness against several methods for\nassigning luminosity to dark matter halos, for merging CfA1 galaxies, and for\nbreaking up massive over-mergers (2) When allowance is made for the high large\nscale power P(k) present in the CfA1 data, CHDM at our $\\Omnu=0.30$ produces\nslightly too many groups and groups too high a fraction of the galaxies, while\nthe fraction grouped in CDM is far too low. Lowering $\\Omnu$ would appear to\nproduce close agreement with all measures, save one: for all simulations,\nmedian group sizes are x1.4-1.7 larger than equivalently selected CfA1 groups.\n(3) The standard group M/L method gives $\\Omega\\simeq 0.1$ for CHDM and CfA1,\nand $\\Omega\\simeq 0.35$ for CDM. A conspiracy of three effects produce these\nvery low values, and we conclude that low observed $\\Omega$'s need not argue\nfor a low $\\Omega$ universe. When overmergers are broken up, the median virial-\nto-DM mass of 3D selected groups is $\\sim1$ for all simulations.\n$M_{DM}>10^{14}\\Msun$ groups appear virialized in all simulations. Global\nvelocity biases $b_v$ are similar to previous studies. Within 3D-selected\ngroups, CHDM and CDM b=1.5 show a stronger bias of $b_v=0.7-0.8$, while CDM\nb=1.0 shows group $b_v$'s $\\simeq 1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 1994 00:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
