We generalize their construction for any $(p,q)$\nminimal model coupled to two dimensional (2d) gravity and show that the\nenergy--momentum tensor and the topological charge of a constrained topological\nsigma model can be mapped to the energy--momentum tensor and the BRST charge of\n$c_M<1$ string theory at zero cosmological constant. We systematically study\nthe physical state spectrum of this topological sigma model and recover the\nspectrum in the absolute cohomology of $c_M<1$ string theory. This procedure\nprovides us a manifestly topological representation of the continuum Liouville\nformulation of $c_M<1$ string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 1994 15:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}
