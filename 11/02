A R-matrix formulation is used, with the initial\nstate described by a shell model. The R-matrix parameters are obtained by\nfitting the alpha-\\alpha scattering phase shifts and allowed beta-decay rates.\nBecause the nuclear final state interaction effects on the time reversal test\ncome from second forbidden beta-decays, they are small and can be minimized by\na suitable choice of kinematic conditions. The e(+/-)-nucleus Coulomb\ninteraction induced T-violation effects depend on the first forbidden\noperators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 1994 21:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
