However, recent evolution\nmodels for massive stars including mass loss suggest that the yield of C\nrelative to O may increase with metallicity; new chemical evolution models for\nthe solar neighborhood which account for this predict a C/O abundance evolution\nsimilar to that observed in the metal-poor galaxies.

Among the evolutionary influences on the population is\nthe destruction of globular clusters by tidal forces as the cluster moves\nthrough the field of influence of a disk, a bulge, and/or a putative nuclear\ncomponent (black hole). We have conducted a series of N-body simulations of\nglobular clusters on bound and marginally bound orbits through potentials that\ninclude black hole and spheroidal components. The degree of concentration of\nthe spheroidal component can have a considerable impact on the extent to which\na globular cluster is disrupted. If half the mass of a $10^{10} \\msun$ spheroid\nis concentrated within 800pc, then only black holes with masses $>10^9 \\msun$\ncan have a significant tidal influence over that already exerted by the bulge.\nHowever, if the matter in the spheroidal component is not so strongly\nconcentrated toward the center of the galaxy, a more modest central black hole\n(down to $10^8 \\msun$) could have a dominant influence on the globular cluster\ndistribution, particularly if many of the clusters were initially on highly\nradial orbits. Our simulations show that the stars that are stripped from a\nglobular cluster follow orbits with roughly the same eccentricity as the\ninitial cluster orbit, spreading out along the orbit like a ``string of\npearls''. Since only clusters on close to radial orbits will suffer substantial\ndisruption, the population of stripped stars will be on orbits of high\neccentricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 1994 03:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

These ambiguities are caused by infrared renormalons,\nwhich are a general feature of resummed hard-scattering functions in\nperturbative QCD, even though these functions are infrared safe order-by-order\nin perturbation theory. As in the case of the operator product expansion, the\ncontributions of infrared renormalons to coefficient functions may be absorbed\ninto the definition of higher-dimensional operators, which induce\nnonperturbative corrections that are power-suppressed at high energies. The\nstrength of the suppression is determined by the location of the dominant\ninfrared renormalon, which may be identified explicitly in the resummed series.\nIn contrast to the operator product expansion, however, the relevant operators\nin factorized hadron-hadron scattering and jet cross sections are generally\nnonlocal in QCD, although they may be expressed as local operators in an\neffective theory for eikonalized quarks.
