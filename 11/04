In particular, we have measured dielectrons\n(e+e-) from p-p and p-d collisions to understand the basic dilepton production\nmechanisms in the energy range from 1.05 - 4.9 GeV. These data can be used to\ndetermine the basic processes which contribute to nucleon-nucleon dilepton\nproduction such as hadronic bremsstrahlung, vector meson processes, and\nhadronic Dalitz decay. The data show that a simple elastic bremsstrahlung\ncalculation is insufficient to explain the data. Theoretical models are\ncompared with the data. A new high statistics study of Ca-Ca at 1.05 A GeV has\nbeen made to study the collectivity of A-A collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 1994 01:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
