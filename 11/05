This series of papers investigates what\nmicrolensing can teach us about the structure and shape of the dark halo. In\nthis paper we present formulas for the microlensing rate, optical depth and\nevent duration distributions for a simple set of axisymmetric disk-halo models.\nThe halos are based on the \"power--law models\" which have simple velocity\ndistributions. Using these models, we show that there is a large uncertainty in\nthe predicted microlensing rate because of uncertainty in the halo parameters.\nFor example, models which reproduce the measured galactic observables to within\ntheir errors still differ in microlensing rate towards the Magellanic Clouds by\nmore than a factor of ten. We find that while the more easily computed optical\ndepth correlates well with microlensing rate, the ratio of optical depth to\nrate can vary by a factor of two (or greater if the disk is maximal).\nComparison of microlensing rates towards the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds\n(LMC and SMC) and M31 can be used to aid determinations of the halo flattening\nand rotation curve slope. For example, the ratio of microlensing rates towards\nthe LMC and SMC is $\\sim 0.7-0.8$ for E0 halos and $\\sim 1.0 - 1.2$ for E7\nhalos (c.f. Sackett \\& Gould 1993). Once the flattening has been established,\nthe ratio of microlensing rates towards M31 and the LMC may help to distinguish\nbetween models with rising, flat or falling rotation curves. Comparison of\nrates along LMC and galactic bulge lines-of-sight gives useful information on\nthe halo core radius, although this may not be so easy to extract in practice.\nMaximal disk models provide substantially smaller halo optical depths, shorter\nevent durations and even larger model uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 1994 22:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
