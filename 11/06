From the mathematical viewpoint, the\nHiggs nature of gravity issues from the fact that different gravitational\nfields are responsible for nonequivalent representations of cotangent vectors\nto a world manifold by $\\gamma$-matrices on spinor bundles. It follows that\ngravitational fields fail to form an affine space modelled on a linear space of\ndeviations of some background field. In other words, even weak gravitational\nfields do not satisfy the superposition principle and, in particular, can not\nbe quantized by usual methods. At the same time, one can examine superposable\ndeviations $\\sigma$ of a gravitational field $h$ so that $h+\\sigma$ fails to be\na gravitational field. These deviations are provided with the adequate\nmathematical description in the framework of the affine group gauge theory in\ndislocated manifolds, and their Lagrangian densities differ from the familiar\ngravitational ones. They make contribution to the standard gravitational\neffects, e.g., modify Newton's gravitational potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 1994 00:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
