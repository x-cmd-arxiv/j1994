Denjoy proved\nthat approximately continuous functions are Baire 1., i.e., pointwise For any\nf:R^2 -> R define f_x(y) = f^y(x) = f(x,y). A function f:R^2 -> R is separately\ncontinuous if f_x and f^y are continuous for every x,y in R. Lebesgue in his\nfirst paper proved that any separately continuous function is Baire 1.\nSierpinski showed that there exists a nonmeasurable f:R^2 -> R which is\nseparately Baire 1.\n  In this paper we prove:\n  Thm 1. Let f:R^2 -> R be such that f_x is approximately continuous and f^y is\nBaire 1 for every x,y in R. Then f is Baire 2.\n  Thm 2. Suppose there exists a real-valued measurable cardinal.
