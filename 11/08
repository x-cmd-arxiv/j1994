In the process, we demonstrate that the bar modes in stellar\nsystems and the m=2 I-modes in gaseous systems have many common physical\ncharacteristics and only one substantial difference: because of the anisotropy\nof the stress tensor, dynamical instability sets in at lower rotation in\nstellar systems. This difference is reflected also in the new stability\ncriterion. The new stability parameter \"alpha\" is formulated first for\nuniformly rotating systems and is based on the angular momentum content rather\nthan on the energy content of a system. For stability of stellar systems\n\"alpha\" = 0.254-0.258, while it is in the range of 0.341-0.354 for gaseous\nsystems. For uniform rotation, one can write \"alpha\" as a function of the total\n(rotational) kinetic and gravitational energies, and of a parameter which is\ncharacteristic of the topology/connectedness and the geometric shape of a\nsystem. \"Alpha\" can be extended to and calculated for a variety of\ndifferentially rotating, gaseous and stellar, axisymmetric disk and spheroidal\nmodels whose equilibrium structures and stability characteristics are known.

The width-degree of an element x\nin at least one member of F is the width of the family {U in F | x in U}. If F\nhas maximum width-degree at most k, then F is locally k-wide. Bounds on the\nsize of locally k-wide families of sets are established. If F is locally k-wide\nand centered (every U in F has an element which does not belong to any member\nof F incomparable to U), then |F| <= (k+1)(n-k/2); this bound is best possible.\nNearly exact bounds, linear in n and k, on the size of locally k-wide families\nof arcs or segments are determined. If F is any locally k-wide family of sets,\nthen |F| is linearly bounded in n. The proof of this result involves an\nanalysis of the combinatorics of antichains. Let P be a poset and L a\nsemilattice (or an intersection-closed family of sets). The P-size of L is\n|L^P|. For u in L, the P-density of u is the ratio |[u)^P|/|L^P|. The density\nof u is given by the [1]-density of u. Let p be the number of filters of P. L\nhas the P-density property iff there is a join-irreducible a in L such that the\nP-density of a is at most 1/p Which non-trivial semilattices have the P-density\nproperty? For P=[1], it has been conjectured that the answer is: \"all\" (the\nunion-closed sets conjecture). Certain subdirect products of lower-semimodular\nlattices and, for P=[n], of geometric lattices have the P-density property in a\nstrong sense. This generalizes some previously known results. A fixed lattice\nhas the [n]-density property if n is large enough. The density of a generator U\nof a union-closed family of sets L containing the empty set is estimated. The\nestimate depends only on the local properties of L at U. If L is generated by\nsets of size at most two, then there is a generator U of L with estimated\ndensity at most 1/2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 1994 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
