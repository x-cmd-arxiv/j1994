A necessary ingredient to enforce R-parity is the\npossibility of distinguishing the lepton superfields from the Higgs ones. This\nis generally achieved either by assuming different charges under some matter\nparity, or by assigning the superfields to different representations of a\nunified gauge group. We want to put forward the idea that the replica of the\nfermion generations, which constitute an intrinsic difference between the\nfermions and the Higgs superfields, can give a clue to understand R-parity as\nan accidental symmetry. More ambitiously, we suggest a possible relation\nbetween proton stability and the actual number of fermion generations. We carry\nout our investigation in the framework of non-Abelian horizontal gauge\nsymmetries. We identify $SU(4)_H$ as the only acceptable horizontal gauge group\nwhichcan naturally ensure the absence of R parity violating operators, without\nconflicting with other theoretical and phenomenological constraints. We analyze\na version of the supersymmetric standard model equipped with a gauged\nhorizontal $SU(4)_H$, in which R-parity is accidental. The model predicts four\nfamilies of fermions, it allows for the dynamical generation of a realistic\nhierarchy of fermion masseswithout any ad hoc choice of small Yukawa couplings,\nit ensures in a natural way the heaviness of all the fourth family fermions\n(including the neutrino) and it predicts a {\\it lower} limit for the\n$\\tau$-neutrino mass of a few eV. The scale of the breaking of the horizontal\nsymmetry can be constrained rather precisely in a narrow window around $\\sim\n10^{11}$ GeV. Some interesting astrophysical and cosmological implications of\nthe model are addressed as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 1994 20:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 1995 02:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
