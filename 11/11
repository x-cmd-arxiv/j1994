Much of this complexity can be described and\nunderstood by taking a statistical approach to the energetics of protein\nconformation, that is, to the energy landscape. The statistical energy\nlandscape approach explains when and why unique behaviors, such as specific\nfolding pathways, occur in some proteins and more generally explains the\ndistinction between folding processes common to all sequences and those\npeculiar to individual sequences. This approach also gives new, quantitative\ninsights into the interpretation of experiments and simulations of protein\nfolding thermodynamics and kinetics. Specifically, the picture provides simple\nexplanations for folding as a two-state first-order phase transition, for the\norigin of metastable collapsed unfolded states and for the curved Arrhenius\nplots observed in both laboratory experiments and discrete lattice simulations.\nThe relation of these quantitative ideas to folding pathways, to\nuni-exponential {\\em vs.} multi-exponential behavior in protein folding\nexperiments and to the effect of mutations on folding is also discussed.
