(1992),\ntotaling over 3000 spiral galaxies. We treat the cluster data in this paper,\nwhich is the first of a series; in Paper II we treat the field TF samples.\nThese data are to be combined with elliptical data (e.g., Faber et al. 1989) to\nform the MARK III CATALOG OF GALAXY PECULIAR VELOCITIES, which we will present\nin Paper III. The catalog will be used as input for POTENT reconstruction of\nvelocity and density fields, described in later papers, as well as for\nalternative velocity analyses. Our main goal in Papers I & II is to place the\nTF data onto a self-consistent system by (i) applying a uniform set of\ncorrections to the raw observables, (ii) determining the TF slopes and scatters\nseparately for each sample, and (iii) adjusting the TF zeropoints to ensure\nmutually consistent distances. The global zeropoint is set by the HM sample,\nchosen because of its depth and uniformity on the sky and its substantial\noverlap with each of the other samples. In this paper, we calibrate the\n``forward'' and ``inverse'' TF relations for HM and W91CL. We study the\nselection criteria for these samples and correct for the resultant statistical\nbiases. The bias corrections are validated by comparing forward and inverse\ncluster distances. We find that many sample clusters are better modeled as\n``expanding'' than relaxed, which significantly affects the TF calibrations.\nProper corrections for internal extinction are derived self-consistently from\nthe data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 1994 17:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The method is\nbased on gravitational lensing and uses the fact that the mean angular size of\nthe faint blue galaxies is a well-determined function of surface brightness.\nThe method requires first a calibration of the angular-size vs. surface\nbrightness relation in unlensed blank fields and a determination of the mean\nredshift of the brightest of the faint blue galaxies. By combining this\ninformation with observations of the distorted images of background galaxies in\nthe fields of foreground clusters, we show that it is possible to obtain the\nmean redshift of the galaxies as a function of their surface brightness. With a\nsample of about ten moderate redshift rich clusters and using ten bins in\nsurface brightness, a bin-to-bin signal-to-noise ratio of $\\sim3.5$ can be\nachieved. The method simultaneously allows a determination of the convergence\nand shear of the lensing cluster as a function of position, and through this\nthe mass distribution of the lens can be obtained. The lens parallax method can\nbe used in conjunction with, and will improve the accuracy of, other previously\nproposed techniques for mapping clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 1994 20:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Generalizations of this picture to the whole class of\nnon-unitary minimal models $M_{p,2p\\pm 1}$, perturbed by their least relevant\noperator lead to a cascade of flows similar to that of unitary minimal models\nperturbed by $\\phi_{1,3}$. Various aspects and generalizations of this\nphenomenon and the links with the Izergin-Korepin model are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 1994 23:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
