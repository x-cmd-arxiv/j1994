The first\ntechnique is designed to carry out detailed model fitting of continuum power\nspectrum components arising from noise variability by using maximum likelihood\nmethods. The technique is applied to the light curves of a number of highly\nvariable AGNs observed with EXOSAT. Substantially steeper logarithmic power\nspectrum slopes are obtained than previously estimated with standard methods.\nThe second technique was devised in order to reveal coherent periodicities in\nthe presence of ``coloured\" (i.e. non--white) noise variability components from\nthe source. To this aim the power spectra are searched for significant narrow\npeaks superposed on the ``coloured\" continuum components. We present the\nresults of a search for an orbital modulation in the light curves of a sample\nof 25 low mass X--ray binaries (LMXRBs), for which the orbital period is either\nunknown or detected only at optical wavelengths. This led to the discovery of a\nsignificant X--ray orbital modulation at the few percent level in the burster\nMXB1636-539.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 1994 12:01:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A restricted uniqueness\ntheorem is obtained, applying to solutions that fall off in time at any fixed\nspatial position. For a complementary class of spacetimes in which CTC's are\nconfined to a compact region, we show that when solutions exist they are unique\nin regions exterior to the CTC's. (We believe that more stringent uniqueness\ntheorems hold, and that the present limitations are our own.) An extension of\nthese results to Maxwell fields and massless spinor fields is sketched.\nFinally, we discuss a conjecture that the Cauchy problem for free fields is\nwell defined in the presence of CTC's whenever the problem is well-posed in the\ngeometric-optics limit. We provide some evidence in support of this conjecture,\nand we present counterexamples that show that neither existence nor uniqueness\nis guaranteed under weaker conditions.
