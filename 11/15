In any of the $q$ ordered phases, we show\nthat the matrix $G^{mn}(x-y)$ has one tivial eigenvalue 0, one simple eigen-\nvalue $G_{\\wir}^{(1)}(x-y)$ and one ($q-2$)-fold degenerate eigenvalue\n$G_{\\wir}^{(2)}(x-y)$. Furthermore, we identify the eigenvalues both in terms\nof representations of the unbroken symmetry group of the model, and in terms of\nconnectivities and cluster covariances, thereby attributing algebraic signifi-\ncance to these stochastic geometric quantities. In addition to establishing the\nexistence of the correlation lengths $\\xi_{\\wir}^{(1)}$ and $\\xi_{\\wir}^{(2)}$\ncorresponding to $G_{\\wir}^{(1)}(x-y)$ and $G_{\\wir}^{(2)}(x-y)$, we show that\n$\\xi_{\\wir}^{(1)}(\\beta)\\geq \\xi_{\\wir}^{(2)}(\\beta)$ for all inverse tempera-\ntures $\\beta$.

This possibility has been advocated\nrecently by Hernquist, Katz \\& Weinberg (1994). Here, we propose a test for\nthis hypothesis using X--ray emission from CGs. The observable quantity $Q\n\\equiv L_{x} a_{p}^{3}/L_{g}^2 T_{x}^{1/2}$ should be proportional to the axis\nratio of the group, $a/c$, where $a$ and $c$ are the long and short axis of a\nprolate distribution, $a_p$ is the radius of the group projected onto the sky,\n$L_{x}$ is the bolometric X-ray luminosity, $L_{g}$ is the group blue\nluminosity, and $T_{x}$ is the gas temperature. We find that the distribution\nof $Q$ is consistent with the notion that many spiral-rich CGs with unusually\nsmall values of ($a/c)$ are frauds, i.e. that the values of $Q$ are anomalously\nsmall. An alternative possibility is that CGs are gas-poor relative to rich\nclusters; however, this can be tested using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. If\nthe groups have a normal ratio of gas-to-total mass, but are simply stretched\nout along the line of sight, a Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal should be detectable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 1994 17:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The\neffect occurs whenever the distortion to the redshift distribution of\nLyman-alpha clouds induced by the cluster potential extends beyond the\nproximity effect of the quasar. Based on CDM cosmological models for the\nevolution of structure, we predict the probability for finding lines beyond the\nquasar redshift ($z_{abs}>z_Q$) under the assumption that the physical\nproperties of Lyman-alpha clouds are not affected by flows on large scales (1\nMpc and more) in the quasi-linear regime. If quasars randomly sample the\nunderlying galaxy distribution, the expected number of lines with $z_{abs}>z_Q$\nper quasar can be as high as 0.25[(dN/dz)/350] at $z=2$, where $dN/dz$ is the\nnumber of Lyman-alpha lines per unit redshift far from the quasar. The\nprobability is enhanced if quasars typically reside in small groups of\ngalaxies. A statistical excess of Lyman-alpha lines is expected near very dim\nquasars or around metal absorption systems. Due to clustering, the standard\napproach to the proximity effect overestimates the ionizing background flux at\nhigh redshifts by up to a factor of 3. This result weakens the discrepancy\nbetween the deduced background flux and the contribution from known populations\nof quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 1994 20:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 1995 17:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Rescattering effects --\nconsecutive excitation and deexcitation of Deltas -- lead to a long apparent\nlifetime (> 10 fm/c) and rather large volumina (several 100 fm^3) of the\nDelta-matter state. Heavier baryon resonances prove to be crucial for reaction\ndynamics and particle production at AGS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 1994 17:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The importance of\npairing correlations in pseudo-SU(3) model calculations is demonstrated by\nexamining the dependence of wavefunctions, low-energy collective excitation\nspectra, and moments of inertia on the strength of the pairing interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 1994 00:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
