The next two, the random walk\ntest and the $n$-block test, are based on studies of random walks, and the\ncondition number test presented last uses some results of Gaussian distributed\nrandom matrices. Studies with several commonly used pseudorandom number\ngenerators reveal that the cluster test is particularly powerful in finding\nperiodic correlations on bit level, and that the autocorrelation test, the\nrandom walk test, and the $n$-block test are very effective in detecting\nshort-ranged correlations. The results of the condition number test are mostly\ninconclusive, however. By means of the tests presented in this work, two\nimportant results are found. First, we show quantitatively that the reason for\nerroneous results in some recent high precision Monte Carlo simulations for\nsome commonly used pseudorandom number generators are the so called triple\ncorrelations in the sequences.

However, a similar boosting procedure for a\ncharged black hole solution in dilaton gravity yields some mixing : the wave\nfunction of even a neutral test particle, acquires a small additional phase\nfactor depending on the dilatonic black hole charge.
