Likewise, it is not known exactly what sizes can occur\nfor an even set of nodes on S.\n  We show that an nonempty even set of nodes on S must have size 24, 32, 40,\n56, or 64.

These twists are closely related to algebraic\ndeformations and also to the theory of quasi-triangular bialgebras. In\nparticular, a deformation produced from a universal deformation formula (UDF)\nis a special case of a twist. The most familiar example of a deformation\nproduced from a UDF is perhaps the \"Moyal product\" which (locally) is the\ncanonical quantization of the algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold in\nthe direction of the Poisson bracket. In this case, the derivations comprising\nthe Poisson bracket mutually commute and so this quantization is essentially\nobtained by exponentiating this bracket. For more general Poisson manifolds,\nthis formula is not applicable since the associated derivations may no longer\ncommute. We provide here generalizations of the Moyal formula which (locally)\ngive canonical quantizations of various Poisson manifolds. Specifically,\nwhenever a certain central extension of a Heisenberg Lie group acts on a\nmanifold, we obtain a quantization of its algebra of functions in the direction\nof a suitable Poisson bracket obtained from noncommuting derivations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 1994 23:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
