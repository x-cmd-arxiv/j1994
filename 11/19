Fragmentation, occurring at the end of the\nsecondary collapse phase (during which molecular hydrogen is dissociating), can\nform binary systems with separations less than 1 au. Two fragmentation modes\nare found to occur after the collapse is halted. The first consists of the\nfragmentation of a protostellar disc due to rotational instabilities in a\nprotostellar core, involving both an $m=1$ and an $m=2$ mode. This\nfragmentation mechanism is found to be insensitive to the initial density\ndistribution: it can occur in both centrally condensed and uniform initial\nconditions. The second fragmentation mode involves the formation of a rapidly\nrotating core at the end of the collapse phase which is unstable to the\naxisymmetric perturbations. This core bounces into a ring which quickly\nfragments into several components. The binary systems thus formed contain less\nthan 1 per cent of a solar mass and therefore will need to accrete most of\ntheir final mass if they are to form a binary star system. Their orbital\nproperties will thus be determined by the properties of the accreted matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 1994 16:39:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 1994 17:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
