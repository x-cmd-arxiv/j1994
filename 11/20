For $q=10$ the transition seems to be of 2nd order, while it seems to\nbe of 3rd order for $q=200$. For $q=200$ the phase transition also induces a\ntransition between typical fractal structures of the piecewise linear surfaces\ncorresponding to the triangulations. The typical surface changes from having a\ntree-like structure to a fractal structure characterizing pure gravity when the\ntemperature drops below the critical temperature.

The two--point\ncorrelation function, $G(x, y)$, is the only $n$-point correlation function\nwhich survives in this limit. We analyze the short distance and long distance\nbehaviour of $G(x, y)$. It is shown that $G(x, y)$ decays exponentially with\nthe Riemannian distance on the spaces $R^2 \\times S^1,~S^1 \\times S^1 \\times R,\n~S^2 \\times R,~H^2 \\times R$. The decay on $R^3$ is of course a power law. We\nshow that the scale for the correlation length is given by the geometry of the\nspace and therefore the long distance behaviour of the critical correlation\nfunction is not necessarily a power law even though the manifold is of infinite\nextent in all directions; this is the case of the hyperbolic space where the\nradius of curvature plays the role of a scale parameter.
