We do not see any correlation between the presence (or the\nsign) of a color gradient and the BCG morphology (slope and shape of its\nsurface brightness profile), or the cluster richness. This argues against a\nstrong and recent influence of the environment on the BCG morphology. The slope\nof the BCG surface brightness profile is correlated to the cluster richness,\nposing a constraint on the initial conditions, or on the physical mechanism\nthat is responsible for the present BCG morphology.
