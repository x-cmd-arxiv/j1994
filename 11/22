(${\\cal\nA}$ and $\\kappa$ denote the area and the surface gravity of the horizon,\nrespectively.) Together with the fact that the Komar integral provides a simple\nrelation between $M - (4\\pi)^{-1} \\kappa A$ and the strong energy condition,\nthis enables us to prove that the Schwarzschild metric represents the only\nstatic, spherically symmetric black hole solution of a selfgravitating matter\nmodel satisfying the dominant, but violating the strong energy condition for\nthe timelike Killing field $K$ at every point, that is, $R(K,K) \\leq 0$.\nApplying this result to scalar fields, we recover the fact that the only black\nhole configuration of the spherically symmetric Einstein-Higgs model with\narbitrary non-negative potential is the Schwarzschild spacetime with constant\nHiggs field. In the presence of electromagnetic fields, we also derive a\nstronger bound for the total mass, involving the electromagnetic potentials and\ncharges. Again, this estimate provides a simple tool to prove a ``no-hair''\ntheorem for matter fields violating the strong energy condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 1994 16:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}
