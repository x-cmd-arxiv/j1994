The model depends on only few parameters and\ncan be constrained by observations. Thus we are able to show that radio and\nX-ray fluxes (SSC emission) of cores and lobes and typical dimensions of radio\nloud quasars are consistent with a jet being produced in the central engine. We\npresent a synthetic broadband spectrum from radio to X-ray for a jet-disk\nsystem. The only way to explain the high efficiency of radio loud objects is to\npostulate that these objects consist of `maximal jets' with `total\nequipartition' where the magnetic energy flow of the jet is comparable to the\nkinetic jet power and the total jet power is a large fraction of the disk\npower. As the number of electrons is limited by the accretion flow, this is\nonly possible when the minimum Lorentz factor of the electron distribution is\n$\\gamma_{\\rm e,min}\\ga100$ ($E\\ga 50 {\\rm MeV}$) or/and a large number of pairs\nare present. Such an electron/positron population would be a necessary\nconsequence of hadronic interactions and may lead to some interesting effects\nin the low frequency self-absorbed spectrum. Emission from radio weak quasars\ncan be explained with an initially identical jet. The difference between radio\nloud and radio weak could be due to a different efficiency in accelerating\nrelativistic electrons on the sub-parsec scale. Finally we demonstrate that in\norder to appease the ravenous hunger of radio loud jets its production must be\nsomehow linked to the dissipation process in the inner part of the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 1994 09:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

It is shown\nthat observables localized at the boundaries (edge observables) can occur in\nsuch models irrespective of the dimensionality of spacetime. The intimate\nconnection of these observables to charge fractionation, vertex operators and\ntopological field theories is described. The edge observables, however, may or\nmay not exist as well-defined operators in a fully quantized theory depending\non the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and their momenta. The latter\nare obtained by requiring the Hamiltonian of the theory to be self-adjoint and\npositive definite. We show that these boundary conditions can also have nice\nphysical interpretations in terms of certain experimental parameters such as\nthe penetration depth of the electromagnetic field in a surrounding\nsuperconducting medium. The dependence of the spectrum on one such parameter is\nexplicitly exhibited for the Higgs model on a spatial disc in its London limit.\nIt should be possible to test such dependences experimentally, the above Higgs\nmodel for example being a model for a superconductor. Boundary conditions for\nthe 3+1 dimensional $BF$ system confined to a spatial ball are studied. Their\nphysical meaning is clarified and their influence on the edge states of this\nsystem (known to exist under certain conditions) is discussed. It is pointed\nout that edge states occur for topological solitons of gauge theories such as\nthe 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 1994 23:59:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 1994 16:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
