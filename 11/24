In a radio/$L_{\\rm disk}$ plot we\nfind the quasars to be separated into four classes: core dominated quasars\n(CDQ), lobe dominated quasars (LDQ), radio-intermediate quasars (RIQ) and radio\nweak quasars. In general the radio core emission scales with the disk\nluminosity, especially in the radio weak quasars. This shows that radio and UV\nemission have a common energy source and that the difference between radio loud\nand radio weak is established already on the parsec scale. We investigate the\npossibility that radio jets are responsible for the radio core emission in\nradio loud and radio weak quasars. Comparing our data with a simple jet\nemission model that takes the limits imposed by energy and mass conservation in\na coupled jet-disk system into account, we find that radio loud jets carry a\ntotal power $Q_{\\rm jet}$ that is at least 1/3 of the observed disk luminosity\n$L_{\\rm disk}$. For the electron population one is forced to postulate an\nefficient process producing a large number of pairs and/or injecting electrons\nwith a distribution with low-energy cut-off around 50 MeV -- secondary pair\nproduction in hadronic cascades could be such a process. The bulk Lorentz\nfactor of the jet is limited to a narrow region ($3\\la\\gamma_{\\rm j}\\la10$)).\nThe radio emission of radio weak quasars can be explained with exactly the same\nparameters for a powerful relativistic jet if secondary pair production, as\nsuggested for radio loud jets, is inhibited. There is evidence that RIQ are the\nrelativistically boosted population of radio weak quasar jets. We can estimate\nthe hidden disk luminosity of FR II galaxies and find that this is consistent\nwith FRII being misdirected quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 1994 08:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

The central point is to study algebras of physical observables\nand their irreducible representations. In classical mechanics one deals with\nreal Poisson algebras, whereas in quantum mechanics the observables have the\nstructure of a real non-associative Jordan-Lie algebra. The non-associativity\nis proportional to $\\pl^2$, hence for $\\pl\\raw 0$ one recovers a real Poisson\nalgebra. This observation lies at the basis of `strict' deformation\nquantization, where one deforms a given Poisson algebra into a $C^*$-algebra,\nin such a way that the basic algebraic structures are preserved. Our main\ninterest lies in degenerate Poisson algebras and their quantization by\nnon-simple Jordan-Lie algebras. The traditional symplectic manifolds of\nclassical mechanics, and their quantum counterparts (Hilbert spaces and\noperator algebras which act irreducibly) emerge from a generalized\nrepresentation theory. This two-step procedure sheds considerable light on the\nsubject. We discuss a large class of examples, in which the Poisson algebra\ncanonically associated to an (integrable) Lie algebroid is deformed into the\nJordan-Lie algebra of the corresponding Lie groupoid.
