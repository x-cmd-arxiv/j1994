These\nstates correspond to the energy density operator of the associated nonlinear\nsigma model. We exhibit that there exists a subclass of relevant operators\nforming a closed fusion algebra. We make use of these operators to perform\nrenormalizable perturbations of the $SU(1,1)/U(1)$ coset. In the infra-red\nlimit, the perturbed theory flows to another conformal model. We identify one\nof the perturbative conformal points with the $SU(2)/U(1)$ coset at positive\nlevel. {}From the point of view of the string target space geometry, the given\nrenormalization group flow maps the euclidean black hole geometry described by\nthe $SU(1,1)/U(1)$ coset into the sphere described by the $SU(2)/U(1)$ coset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 1994 14:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
