They represent a class of new physics, which\nhas the potential to change the parameters of the $Z$ boson and at the same\ntime interferes with their determination from the data. We show that in the\npresence of such operators the $Z$ parameters obtained from lineshape fits can\nchange significantly. Another important property of these operators is that\nthey spoil the factorization of the expression for the left-right asymmetry,\n$A_{LR}$, into initial and final state couplings. Factorization and subsequent\ncancellation of the final state coupling occurs in the Standard Model (after\ncorrecting for photonic amplitudes) and is crucial for the interpretation of\n$A_{LR}$ as a measurement of the effective weak mixing angle. Four-Fermi\noperators may thus provide an explanation for the high value of the\npolarization asymmetry as observed at SLC. However, the data from lower energy\n$e^+$ $e^-$ annihilation severely constrains this class of operators and\nvirtually closes this possible loophole on how new physics might explain the\nSLC/LEP discrepancy. We point out that if the surplus of observed $b$-pairs at\nLEP is real and caused by these operators, there may be a significant effect on\nthe forward-backward asymmetry into $b$-quarks.
