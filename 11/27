Independent of the alpha' expansion, there is a six-parameter\nfamily of such configurations, labelled by the charges characterizing the\nasymptotic behaviour of the various fields: ie their mass, dilaton charge,\naxion charge, electric charge, magnetic charge, and Taub-NUT parameter. We show\nthat duality, based on time-translation invariance, maps these solutions\namongst themselves, with the effect of interchanging two pairs of these six\nlabels, namely: (1) the mass and dilaton charge, and (2) the axion charge and\nthe Taub-NUT parameter. We consider in detail the special case of the purely\nSchwarzschild black hole, for which the mass of the dual configuration vanishes\nto leading order in alpha'. Working to next-to-leading order in alpha' for the\nbosonic and heterotic strings, we find that duality takes a black hole of mass\nM to a (singular) solution having mass - 1/(alpha' M).
