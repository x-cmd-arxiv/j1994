We argue that the opening angle of the obscuring torus in radio loud\nquasars depends on the power of the central engine, approaching the jet's\nbeaming angle near the FR I/FR II break. Consequently, low power radio quasars\nwould either be classified as radio galaxies (FR I) or strongly core-boosted\n(BL Lac) object, depending on the aspect angle, and no conspicuous transitional\npopulation would be expected for FR I sources. A closing torus with decreasing\npower would not only obscure the optical nucleus for most aspect angles but\nwould also enhance the entrainment of the cool torus material into the jet\nstream, causing obscuration along the jet's periphery, as well as the jet's\ndeceleration to form a FR I source. Above a critical luminosity, the wider\ntorus allows for FR II type jets and visibility of the nuclear optical\nemission, characteristic of radio loud quasars. Apparently, at the same engine\npower the torus opening in radio weak quasars and Seyferts is substantially\nwider than in radio loud quasars, probably because of different dynamics or\nfeeding mechanisms in disk and elliptical galaxies. This provides a clue for\nthe radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy of quasars if the the jet/torus\ninteraction leads to injection of relativistic e^+/- pairs via p-p collisions.\nStrong jet/torus interaction may lead to a substantial injection of secondary\npairs and collimation in radio loud quasars, while weak interaction in radio\nweak quasars leads neither to pair injection nor to good collimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 1994 08:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By virtue of such a gauge symmetry we can greatly simplify the\nanalysis of the SD equation by taking the most appropriate gauge (``nonlocal\ngauge'') for the HLS.\n  In the case of even-number of (2-component) fermions, we find the dynamical\nfermion mass generation as the second order phase transition at certain fermion\nnumber, which breaks the chiral symmetry but preserves the parity in (2+1)\ndimensions ($D=3$). In the infinite four-fermion coupling (massless gauge\nboson) limit in (2+1) dimensions, the result coincides with that of the\n(2+1)-dimensional QED, with the critical number of the 4-component fermion\nbeing $N_{\\rm cr} = \\frac{128}{3\\pi^{2}}$. As to the case of odd-number\n(2-component) fermion in (2+1) dimensions, the regularization ambiguity on the\ninduced Chern-Simons term may be resolved by specifying the regularization so\nas to preserve the HLS.\n  Our method also applies to the (1+1) dimensions, the result being consistent\nwith the exact solution. The bosonization mechanism in (1+1) dimensional\nThirring model is also reproduced in the context of dual-transformed theory for\nthe HLS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 1994 13:30:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 1994 08:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
