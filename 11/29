As a consequence\nof this suspensions are characterized, up to topological conjugacy, as the only\n$3$-dimensional Anosov flows without freely homotopic closed orbits.\nFurthermore the structure of branching is related to the topology of the\nmanifold: if there are infinitely many leaves not separated from each other,\nthen there is an incompressible torus transverse to the flow. Transitivity is\nnot assumed for these results. Finally, if the manifold has negatively curved\nfundamental group we derive some important properties of the limit sets of\nleaves in the universal cover.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 1994 18:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The origin of this weakened coupling is traced to a\nhidden translation symmetry in the linear problem, which is related to the\nexistence of a characteristic frame traveling at the group velocity of each\nwavetrain.
