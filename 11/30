The model is based on a generalized effective-mass equation where a\nnonlinear coupling is introduced to account for those inelastic scattering\nphenomena. The nonlinear term depends on one parameter which is the only\nconstant in the model to be determined phenomenologically from experimental\ndata. As an example of the application of the model, we discuss\nGaAs-Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$As double-barrier structures. When the nonlinear term is\nconsidered, a sideband is observed at an energy of the order of the LO phonon\nenergy in GaAs in addition to and below the main transmission peak. Fitting of\nthe computed spectrum to known experimental results allows to find the value of\nthe nonlinear coupling. As a consequence, we can estimate the electron-phonon\ncoupling from the shift of the main transmission peak in comparison to the\nlinear resonant tunneling. We obtain good agreement with values coming from\nmore sophisticated treatments, which supports our claim that the nonlinear term\nconsistently includes electron-phonon effects. Finally, we use our simple model\nto study magnitudes of interest for applications, namely $I-V$ characteristics,\nwhich are shown to present two negative differential resistance peaks arising\nfrom the main transmission peak and the sideband.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 1994 09:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Gamma ray spectra\nextending to $GeV$ energies suggest the possiblity of accompanying neutrino\nemission, and there are several models proposed suggesting the potential\ndetectability of such coincident neutrino bursts. With this in view, we examine\npossible measurements that might be conducted to give experimental data useful\nfor astronomy, for cosmology and also neutrino properties. Of interest to\nastronomy and cosmology, we show how measurement of neutrino flavor ratios\nyields information on the nature and relative distance of the source. We point\nout that cosmological time dilation might be measured for these sources using\nneutrinos, as has been done for photons, and that neutrino oscillation lengths\nin the range of $1$ to $10^5~Mpc$ can be probed with GRB neutrinos. We thus\nnote that these sources may make possible the first non-electromagnetic\nmeasurements of the scale size of the universe. We discuss tests of the weak\nequivalence principle, tests for flavor dependent gravitational couplings, and\ntests for long time scale variation of physical constants. We also show that a\nnumber of new bounds on neutrino properties (charge, mass, speed, lifetime)\ncould be facilitated to levels well beyond those already inferred from the\nneutrino observation of SN1987A. We also examine the implications of these\nphysics opportunities for designers of neutrino telescopes.
