First we\nuse the Schwarzian differential equation, which we derived previously, to\ncharacterize the mirror map in each case. For algebraic K3 surfaces, we solve\nthe equation in terms of the $J$-function. By deriving explicit modular\nrelations we prove that some K3 mirror maps are algebraic over the genus zero\nfunction field ${\\bf Q}(J)$. This leads to a uniform proof that those mirror\nmaps have integral Fourier coefficients. Regarding the maps as Riemann\nmappings, we prove that they are genus zero functions. By virtue of the\nConway-Norton conjecture (proved by Borcherds using Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman's\nMoonshine module), we find that these maps are actually the reciprocals of the\nThompson series for certain conjugacy classes in the Griess-Fischer group. This\nalso gives, as an immediate consequence, a second proof that those mirror maps\nare integral. We thus conjecture a surprising connection between K3 mirror maps\nand the Thompson series. For threefolds, we construct a formal nonlinear ODE\nfor the quantum coupling reduced $mod\\ p$. Under the mirror hypothesis and an\nintegrality assumption, we derive $mod~p$ congruences for the Fourier\ncoefficients. For the quintics, we deduce (at least for $5\\not{|}d$) that the\ndegree $d$ instanton numbers $n_d$ are divisible by $5^3$ -- a fact first\nconjectured by Clemens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 1994 18:27:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 1994 12:46:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 1994 18:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
