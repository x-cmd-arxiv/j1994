The action may also be used to associate group elements with curves in\nthe space-time manifold, similar to the gauge transformations. The action\nprinciple is shown here to be an equivalence relation between the infinitesimal\nelements so defined for a collection of closed curves and the identity element.\nThe action principle is then extended by requiring the equivalence of global\nelements with the identity and by considering all curves. The resulting\nequation is generalized further to include the non-Abelian gauge fields. The\nextended equation has an infinite number, but not all, trajectories as\nsolutions. The properties of these paths are shown to impart wave-like\nproperties to the particles in motion. These results provide an insight into\nthe wave-particle duality and lead to a modified path-integral formalism. The\nmotion of a particle is formulated within the resulting framework which yields\na generalized Schrodinger equation.

In the Ising model,\nthe limiting commensurate one-dimensional and three-dimensional phases are\nseparated by a commensurate three-sublattice state and by two sectors\ncontaining higher-order commensurate phases. For the Heisenberg model the\nquasi-1D phase is never the equilibrium state; instead the 3D commensurate\nphases exhibits a transition to a continuum of coplanar spiral magnetic phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 1994 15:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

In this paper we discuss\nan algebraic model of nuclear structure, the Interacting Boson Model (IBM), and\nshow that in one limit its group structure is particularly simple.
