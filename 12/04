In these designs, the pools\nin which any clone occurs are equally likely to be any possible selection of\n$k$ from the $v$ pools. The values of $k$ and $v$ can be chosen to optimize\ndesirable properties. Random $k$-sets designs have substantial advantages over\nalternative pooling schemes: they are efficient, flexible, easy to specify,\nrequire fewer pools, and have error-correcting and error-detecting\ncapabilities. In addition, screening can often be achieved in only one pass,\nthus facilitating automation. For design comparison, we assume a binomial\ndistribution for the number of ``positive'' clones, with parameters $n$, the\nnumber of clones, and $c$, the coverage. We propose the expected number of {\\em\nresolved positive} clones---clones which are definitely positive based upon the\npool assays---as a criterion for the efficiency of a pooling design. We\ndetermine the value of $k$ which is optimal, with respect to this criterion, as\na function of $v$, $n$ and $c$. We also describe superior $k$-sets designs\ncalled $k$-sets packing designs. As an illustration, we discuss a robotically\nimplemented design for a 2.5-fold-coverage, human chromosome 16 YAC library of\n$n=1,298$ clones. We also estimate the probability each clone is positive,\ngiven the pool-assay data and a model for experimental errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 1994 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
