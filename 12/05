For such initial\ndata, solutions can be simple traveling fronts or complicated domain walls. Due\nto the well-known thermal-diffusive instabilities when $d$, the Lewis number,\nis sufficiently away from one, front solutions are potentially chaotic. It is\nknown in the literature that solutions are uniformly bounded in time in case $d\nleq 1$ by a simple comparison argument. In case $d >1$, no comparison principle\nseems to apply. Nevertheless, we prove the existence of global classical\nsolutions and show that the $L^{infty}$ norm of $u_2$ can not grow faster than\n$O(log log t)$ for any space dimension.

We first examine the Berry phase induced in the BCS ground\nstate by movement of the vortex and show how this phase enters into the\nhydrodynamic action S_hyd of the condensate. Appropriate variation of S_hyd\ngives F_nd and variation of the Berry phase term is seen to contribute the\nMagnus force of classical hydrodynamics to F_nd. This analysis confirms in\ndetail the arguments of Ao and Thouless within the context of the BCS model.\nOur Berry phase, in the limit e -> 0, reproduces the Berry phase they obtain\nfor a neutral superfluid. A second independent determination of F_nd is given\nthrough a microscopic derivation of the continuity equation for the condensate\nlinear momentum. This yields the acceleration equation for the superflow. The\nvortex is seen to act as a momentum sink and the rate of momentum loss yields\nF_nd. Both calculations yield the same F_nd and show that the Magnus force\ncontribution to F_nd is a consequence of the vortex motion and topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 1994 19:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

From a simultaneous fit to \\bpsi and \\dk data we find that\nstrict heavy quark limit scaling laws applied to the form factors do not hold\nwhen going from $D$ to $B$ and must have large corrections that make softer the\ndependence on the masses. This is in contrast with the matrix elements\nthemselves which are found to need smaller $1/m_Q$ corrections to the\nasymptotic heavy quark scaling laws. We also find that $A_1(q^2)$ should\nincrease slower with \\qq than $A_2, V, f_+$. We propose a simple\nparametrization of these corrections based on a quark model or on an extension\nof the \\hhs laws to the \\hl case, complemented with an approximately constant\n$A_1(q^2)$. This model may be viewed as assuming a precocious validity of\nstrict heavy quark scaling laws for the current matrix elements. Although this\nmodel reproduces qualitatively the wanted features for mass and $q^2$\ndependence, and thus reduces the discrepancy with data, it is insufficient to\nreach a full agreement with the experiment. In our opinion the puzzle is still\nthere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 1994 08:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
