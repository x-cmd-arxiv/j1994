However, clustered models have the\nfollowing drawback: if there is ``enough'' data to train an unclustered model,\nthen the clustered variant may perform worse. On currently used language\nmodeling corpora, e.g. the Wall Street Journal corpus, how do the performances\nof a clustered and an unclustered model compare? While trying to address this\nquestion, we develop the following two ideas. First, to get a clustering\nalgorithm with potentially high performance, an existing algorithm is extended\nto deal with higher order N-grams. Second, to make it possible to cluster large\namounts of training data more efficiently, a heuristic to speed up the\nalgorithm is presented. The resulting clustering algorithm can be used to\ncluster trigrams on the Wall Street Journal corpus and the language models it\nproduces can compete with existing back-off models.

For\na suitable distribution of exchange constants, these models display spin glass\nand quantum paramagnet phases and a zero temperature quantum transition between\nthem.

The spin glass ground state is\nfound to be replica symmetric, with replica symmetry breaking appearing only at\nfinite temperatures. Next we examine the consequences of fluctuations about\nmean-field for the critical properties. Above $d=8$, and with certain\nrestrictions on the values of the Landau couplings, we find that the transition\nis controlled by a Gaussian fixed point with mean-field critical exponents. For\ncouplings not attracted by the Gaussian fixed point above $d=8$, and for all\nphysical couplings below $d=8$, we find runaway renormalization group flows to\nstrong coupling. General scaling relations that should be valid even at the\nstrong coupling fixed point are proposed and compared with Monte Carlo\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 1994 14:38:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 1994 19:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
