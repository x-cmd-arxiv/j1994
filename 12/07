These include the\nnucleon Born terms and the leading $t$-channel vector meson exchanges as the\nnon-resonant pieces. In addition, we consider five resonance contributions in\nthe $s$- and $u$- channel; besides the dominant $N^{*}(1535)$, these are:\n$N^{*}(1440),N^{*}(1520),N^{*}(1650)$ and $N^{*}(1710)$. The amplitudes for the\n$\\pi^\\circ$ and the $\\eta$ photoproduction near threshold have significant\ndifferences, even as they share common contributions, such as those of the\nnucleon Born terms. Among these differences, the contribution to the $\\eta$\nphotoproduction of the $s$-channel excitation of the $N^{*}(1535)$ is the most\nsignificant. We find the off-shell properties of the spin-3/2 resonances to be\nimportant in determining the background contributions. Fitting our effective\namplitude to the available data base allows us to extract the quantity\n$\\sqrt{\\chi \\Gamma_\\eta} A_{1/2}/\\Gamma_T$, characteristic of the\nphotoexcitation of the $N^{*}(1535)$ resonance and its decay into the\n$\\eta$-nucleon channel, of interest to precise tests of hadron models.
