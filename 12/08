Using Monte-\nCarlo simulations, we determine the post-supernova distributions of orbital\nparameters for progeneitors of HMXBs and LMXBs. With the recent distribution of\npulsar birth velocities by Lyne & Lorimer (1994), only about 27% of massive\nsystems remain bound after the supernova, of which about 26% immediately\nexperience dynamical mass transfer and possibly merge to become Thorne-Zytkow\nobjects. The correlations between various orbital parameters can be compared\nwith observational samples to yield information about supernova kick velocities\nand pre-supernova orbital-period distributions. After the supernova, the spins\nof most stars in massive systems have large inclinations with respect to their\norbital axes, and a significant fraction of systems (about 20%) contain stars\nwith retrograde spins. In the case of low-mass companions, we find that about\n19% of systems remain bound after the supernova, of which about 57% experience\nimmediate dynamical mass transfer. There is a tight correlation between the\neccentricity and the post-supernova orbital period in LMXB progeneitors. All\nLMXBs with post-supernova periods longer than a few days initially have large\neccentricities (e.g. Cir X-1 is discussed in this context). We use the results\nof these calculations to simulate the sky distributions of HMXBs and LMXBs. The\nsimulated distributions agree with observed samples.
