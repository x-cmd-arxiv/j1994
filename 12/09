An analysis is made of the outflows and their back affect on\nthe disk structure assuming an ``$\\ap$\" turbulent viscosity model for the disk\nand a magnetic diffusivity comparable to this viscosity. The outflows are found\nto extend over a range of radial distances inward to a distance close to\n$r_{to}$, which is the distance of the maximum of the angular rotation rate of\nthe disk. We find that $r_{to}$ depends on the star's magnetic moment, the\naccretion rate, and the disk's magnetic diffusivity.

When\n$r_{to}$ exceeds the star's corotation radius $r_{cr} = (GM/\\om_*^2)^{1\\ov 3}$,\nwe argue that outflow solutions do not occur, but instead that ``magnetic\nbraking\" of the star by the disk due to field-line twisting occurs in the\nvicinity of $r_{cr}$. The magnetic braking solutions can give spin-up or\nspin-down (or no spin change) of the star depending mainly on the star's\nmagnetic moment and the mass accretion rate.

The relevant small\nparameter is $g=R_c{\\sqrt T_0}$, where $R_c$ is the curvature of the spacetime\nand $T_0$ is the string tension. Within our systematic expansion we obtain to\nzeroth order the null string (string with zero tension), while the first order\ncorrection incorporates the string dynamics. We apply our formalism to quantum\nnull strings in de Sitter spacetime. After a reparametrization of the\nworld-sheet coordinates, the equations of motion are simplified. The quantum\nalgebra generated by the constraints is considered, ordering the momentum\noperators to the right of the coordinate operators. No critical dimension\nappears. It is anticipated however that the conformal anomaly will appear when\nthe first order corrections proportional to $T_0$, are introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 1994 11:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
