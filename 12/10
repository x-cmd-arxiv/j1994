We show that the\nminimization of the functional with respect to overlapping localized orbitals\ncan be performed so as to attain directly the ground state energy, without\nbeing trapped at local minima. The present approach overcomes the multiple\nminima problem present within the original formulation of orbital based $O(N)$\nmethods; it therefore makes it possible to perform $O(N)$ calculations for an\narbitrary system, without including any information about the system bonding\nproperties in the construction of the input wavefunctions.
