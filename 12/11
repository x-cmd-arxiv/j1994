Many of these\ninferences are based on the meaning of particular open class words. Providing a\nrepresentation that can support such lexically-based inferences is a primary\nconcern of lexical semantics. The representation language of first order logic\nhas well-understood semantics and a multitude of inferencing systems have been\nimplemented for it. Thus it is a prime candidate to serve as a lexical\nsemantics representation. However, we argue that FOL, although a good starting\npoint, needs to be extended before it can efficiently and concisely support all\nthe lexically-based inferences needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 1994 16:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The difficulties hidden in such\nan algebraic structure are well known: almost always auxiliary fields can be\nintroduced in order to put the formalism off--shell, but still the field\ndependent gauge transformations give rise to an infinite dimensional algebra\nquite hard to deal with. However, it is possible to avoid all these problems by\ncollecting into an unique nilpotent operator all the symmetries defining the\ntheory, namely ordinary BRS, supersymmetries and translations.
