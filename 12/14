It is shown that a state with classical correlations\nmust be a superposition of states of the form $e^{iS}$. In terms of a reduced\nphase space formalism, this type of state can be expressed as a coherent\nsuperposition of eigenstates of operators that commute with the constraints and\nso correspond to constants of the motion. Contact is made with the usual\nsemiclassical approximation by showing that a superposition of this kind can be\napproximated by a WKB state with an appropriately localised prefactor. A\nqualitative analysis is given of the effects of geometry fluctuations, and the\npossibility of a breakdown of the semiclassical approximation due to\ninterference between neighbouring classical trajectories is discussed. It is\nshown that a breakdown in the semiclassical approximation can be a coordinate\ndependent phenomenon, as has been argued to be the case close to a black hole\nhorizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 1994 16:45:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 1995 16:04:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 1995 14:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

As an application of\nour results, we study the asymptotic behavior of weighted counting functions,\nwhich, if $M$ is compact, is defined for $w \\geq 0$ and $T > 0$ by $$N_{M,w}(T)\n= \\sum\\limits_{\\lambda_n \\leq T}(T-\\lambda_n)^w $$ where $\\{\\lambda_n\\}$ is the\nset of eigenvalues of the Laplacian which acts on the space of smooth functions\non $M$. If $M$ is non-compact, then the weighted counting function is defined\nvia the inverse Laplace transform. Now let $M_{\\ell}$ denote a degenerating\nfamily of compact or non-compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of finite volume\nwhich converges to the non-compact hyperbolic surface $M_{0}$. As an example of\nour results, we have the following theorem: There is an explicitly defined\nfunction $G_{\\ell,w}(T)$ which depends solely on $\\ell$, $w$, and $T$ such that\nfor $w > 3/2$ and $T>0$, we have $$N_{M_{\\ell},w}(T) = G_{\\ell,w}(T)\n+N_{M_{0},w}(T) +o(1)$$ for $\\ell \\to 0$.
