IPNCI plays an important role in\nthe formation of PNC effects, e.g., in neutron-nucleus reactions. In that case,\nit is a technical way to take into account the contribution of the distant\n(small) components of a compound state which dominates the result. The absence\nof such enhancement ($\\sim A^{1/3}$) in the case of T- and P-odd interaction\ncompletes the picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 1994 16:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

For a standard p-wave interaction and an\neffective g' short-range interaction, the dispersion relations for the spin-\nisospin modes, and the associated amplitudes, are calculated at various nuclear\ndensities and temperatures, within the random-phase approximation. Quantities\nof physical interest are then extracted, including the total and partial Delta\ndecay widths and the Delta cross sections in the nuclear medium. The\nself-consistent inclusion of the Delta width has a strong effect on the Delta\ncross sections at twice normal nuclear density, as compared with the result of\nignoring the width. Generally, the obtained quantities exhibit a strong density\ndependence, but are fairly insensitive to the temperature, at least up to T=25\nMeV. Finally, it is described how these in-medium effects may be consistently\nincluded into microscopic transport simulations of nuclear collisions, and the\nimprovements over previous approaches are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 1994 19:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
