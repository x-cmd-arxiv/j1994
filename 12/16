The annihilation of the heavy monopole-antimonopole pairs\nconstituting the monopolonia can produce energetic nucleons, gamma rays and\nneutrinos whose expected flux we estimate and discuss in relation to\nexperimental data so far available. The monopoles we consider are the ones that\ncould be produced in the early universe during a phase transition at the grand\nunification energy scale.
