By\nusing weight functions that fall off smoothly near the galactic cut, it is\nfound that the spectral resolution \\Delta l can be more than doubled at l=15\nand more than tripled at l=20 compared to simply using galaxy-cut spherical\nharmonics. For a future high-resolution experiment with reasonable sky\ncoverage, the resolution around the CDM Doppler peaks would be enhanced by a\nfactor of about 100, down to \\Delta l\\approx 1, thus allowing spectral features\nsuch as the locations of the peaks to be determined with great accuracy. The\nreason that the improvement is so large is basically that functions with a\nsharp edge at the galaxy cut exhibit considerable \"ringing\" in the Fourier\ndomain, whereas smooth functions do not. The method presented here is\napplicable to any survey geometry, chopping strategy and exposure pattern\nwhatsoever. The so called signal-to-noise eigenfunction technique is found to\nbe a special case, corresponding to ignoring the width of the window functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 1994 00:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 1995 11:07:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 1996 13:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Anisotropic asymptotics describe behaviour of correlation\nfunctions when some components of coordinates are large as compare with others\ncomponents. It is occurred that (2+2) anisotropic asymptotics for 4-points\nfunctions are related with the well known Regge regime of scattering\namplitudes. We study an expansion of correlation functions with respect to the\nrescaling parameter $\\lambda$ over a part of variables (anisotropic\n$\\lambda$-expansion). An effective theory describing the anisotropic limit of\nfree scalar field contains two 2 dim conformal theories. One of them is a\nconformal theory in configuration space and another one is a conformal theory\nin momentum space.
