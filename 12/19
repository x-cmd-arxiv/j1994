For a quantum Schwarzschild black hole\nevaporating massless particles the same condition is shown to result in the\nfollowing one-loop temperature $T=(8\\pi M)^{-1} (1+\\sigma (8\\pi M^2)^{-1})$ and\nentropy $S = 4\\pi M^2 - \\sigma\\log M$ expressed in terms of the effective mass\n$M$ of a hole together with its radiation and the integral of the conformal\nanomaly $\\sigma$ that depends on the field species. Thus, in the given case\nquantum corrections to $T$ and $S$ turn out to be completely provided by the\nanomaly. When it is absent ($\\sigma=0$), which happens in a number of\nsupersymmetric models, the one-loop expressions of $T$ and $S$ preserve the\nclassical form. On the other hand, if the anomaly is negative ($\\sigma<0$) an\nevaporating quantum hole seems to cease to heat up when its mass reaches the\nPlanck scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 1994 08:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-30"}
