In this paper we show\nthat the senses and amplitudes of these departures can be naturally accounted\nfor by a simple distribution function constructed on the basis of statistical\nmechanics of violent relaxation. As a consequence, detailed light-profiles can\nbe used to infer about the central potentials of E galaxies (the only free\nshape parameter of our model). Furthermore, the small deviations have recently\nbeen shown to correlate with luminosity, L. This observation entails a slight\nbreaking of the generally assumed structural homology between E galaxies. Using\nour model we parametrize this broken homology by establishing a correlation\nbetween a suitably normalized central potential and luminosity. The\nnon-homology means that a basic assumption in the interpretation of the\nFundamental Plane (FP) breaks down, and with it the conclusions derived from\nit. Instead, by assuming that M/L is independent of luminosity, we derive a\nrelation akin to the FP directly from our correlation. This implies that the FP\nmay have a simple stellar dynamical origin. We can reproduce the observed\nCarlberg-Kormendy relation for the central phase-space densities (f_c) of E\ngalaxies of identical structure, f_c = L^-2.35, but non-homology changes it to\na much weaker dependence (f_c = L^-1.5 for constant M/L) which would imply that\nthe central phase-space densities of ellipticals are comparable to those of\nspiral galaxies. Thus dissipationless merging is consistent with the FP,\nalthough HST observations, notably the presence of nuclear embedded disks,\nindicate that the assumptions behind our model break down for the nuclei of\nfaint E galaxies in which dissipative processes seem to be important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 1994 14:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-22"}

For structure functions at small $x$ and at fixed\ntransverse momentum the angular ordering is masked because of the complete\ninclusive cancellations of collinear singularities for \\xt0. Therefore, in this\ncase the dependence on the hard scale is lost and the angular ordered region\nbecomes equivalent to multi-Regge region in which all transverse momenta are of\nthe same order. In this limit one derives the BFKL equation. In general such a\ncomplete cancellation does not hold for the associated distributions at small\n$x$. The calculation, which requires an analysis without any collinear\napproximation, is done by extending to small $x$ the soft gluon factorization\ntechniques largely uses in the region of large $x$. Since one finds angular\nordering in the both regions of small and large $x$, one can formulate a\nunified evolution equation for the structure function, a unified coherent\nbranching and jet algorithm which allows the calculation of associated\ndistributions in all $x$ regions. Such a unified formulation valid for all $x$\nis presented and compared with usual treatments. In particular we show that the\nassociated distributions at small $x$ are sensitive to coherence. By replacing\nangular ordering with the multi-Regge region one neglects large singular\ncontributions in the associated distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 1994 09:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
