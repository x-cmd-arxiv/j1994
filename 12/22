They are compared and contrasted with the {\\it elementary}\nsolutions which are singular solutions of the field equations with a\n$\\sigma$-model source term and carry a non-vanishing Noether \"electric\" charge.\nIn both cases, the solutions of most interest are those which preserve half the\nspacetime supersymmetries and saturate a Bogomol'nyi bound.

This gives rise to a\nfour-dimensional string/string duality conjecture which subsumes a\nMontonen-Olive type duality in that the magnetic monopoles of the fundamental\nstring correspond to the electric winding states of the dual string. This leads\nto a {\\it duality of dualities} whereby under string/string duality the the\nstrong/weak coupling $S$-duality trades places with the minimum/maximum length\n$T$-duality.

In order to be more self contained, we give a brief\nintroduction to the Langlands program. The theory of $R$--groups and elliptic\nrepresentations is treated here as well. Finally, we give an example which\nillustrates how the theory of twisted endoscopy plays a crucial role in\ndetermining the poles of both the intertwining operators and the local\nLanglands $L$--functions in question. A version of this manuscript, in revised\nform, will appear as a chapter in the proceedings of the conference ``Teoria de\nRepresentaciones de Groupos Algebraicos Sobre Cuerpos Locales y Applicationes''\n(C. Bushnell, P. Kutzko, J. Pantoja, J. Soto Andrade eds.).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 1994 05:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
