The statistical properties of dark haloes are determined from the\ninitial density field (assumed to be Gaussian) through an extension of the\nPress-Schechter formalism. Gravitational clustering is treated by a spherical\nmodel which describes the concentration of dark haloes in collapsing regions.\nWe test this model against results from a variety of N-body simulations. The\nautocorrelation function of dark haloes in such simulations depends\nsignificantly on how haloes are identified. Our predictions agree well with\nresults based on algorithms which break clusters into subgroups more\nefficiently than the standard friends-of-friends algorithm. The agreement is\nbetter than that found by assuming haloes to lie at the present positions of\npeaks of the linear density field. We use these techniques to study how the\ndistribution of haloes is biased with respect to that of the mass. The initial\n(Lagrangian) positions of haloes identified at a given redshift and having\ncircular velocities $v_c=v_c^*(z)$ (i.e. mass equal to the characteristic\nnonlinear mass $M^*$ at that redshift) are very weakly correlated with the\nlinear density field or among themselves. As a result of dynamical evolution,\nhowever, the present-day correlations of these haloes are similar to those of\nthe mass. Haloes with lower $v_c$ are biased toward regions with negative\noverdensity, while those with higher $v_c$ are biased toward regions with\npositive overdensity. Among the haloes identified at any given epoch, those\nwith higher circular velocities are more strongly correlated today.
