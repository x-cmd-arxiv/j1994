In this paper, we propose a method to analyze structures of\nJapanese compound nouns by using both word collocations statistics and a\nthesaurus. An experiment is conducted with 160,000 word collocations to analyze\ncompound nouns of with an average length of 4.9 characters. The accuracy of\nthis method is about 80%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 1994 05:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
