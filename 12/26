In order to reconcile the possible discrepancy between the estimates of\nthe Hubble constants from nearby galaxy samples and high-redshift clusters, we\nconsider a model of locally open universe embedded in the spatially flat\nuniverse. We find analytic expressions for the lower limit on the global Hubble\nconstant $\\hg$, and the upper limit on the age of the universe with a given\nvalue for the Hubble constant $\\hl$ in the local universe. We conclude that it\nis quite unlikely that the above difference in the estimates of the Hubble\nconstant is explained within the framework of the gravitational instability\npicture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 1994 03:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}
