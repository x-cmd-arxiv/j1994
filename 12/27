In\nlarge populations, defectors may escape punishment by roving from partner to\npartner, but defectors in smaller populations risk social isolation. We\ninvestigate these possibilities for an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma in which\nagents use expected payoffs to choose and refuse partners. In comparison to\nrandom or round-robin partner matching, we find that the average payoffs\nattained with preferential partner selection tend to be more narrowly confined\nto a few isolated payoff regions. Most ecologies evolve to essentially full\ncooperative behavior, but when agents are intolerant of defections, or when the\ncosts of refusal and social isolation are small, we also see the emergence of\nwallflower ecologies in which all agents are socially isolated. In between\nthese two extremes, we see the emergence of ecologies whose agents tend to\nengage in a small number of defections followed by cooperation thereafter. The\nlatter ecologies exhibit a plethora of interesting social interaction patterns.\nKeywords: Evolutionary Game; Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma; Partner Choice and\nRefusal; Artificial Life; Genetic Algorithm; Finite Automata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 1994 00:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
