Particularly attractive is the one proposed by\nCallan,Giddings, Harvey and Strominger (CGHS), which is classically solvable\nand contains black hole solutions. Its semi-classical as well as classical\nproperties will be reviewed, including how a flux of matter fields produces a\nblack hole with a subsequent emission of Hawking radiation. Breakdown of such\nan approximation near the horizon, however, calls for exactly solvable variants\nof this model and some attempts in this direction will then be described. A\nfocus will be placed on a model with 24 matter fields, for which exact\nquantization can be performed and physical states constructed. A method will\nthen be proposed to extract space-time geometry described by these states in\nthe sense of quantum average and examples containing a black hole will be\npresented.

The\nrank formula may also be expressed in terms of the cogrowth of $H$. We\nintroduce the rank-growth function $rk_H(i)$ of a subgroup $H$ of a finitely\ngenerated free group $F$. $rk_H(i)$ is defined to be the rank of the subgroup\nof $H$ generated by elements of length less than or equal to $i$ (with respect\nto the generators of $F$), and it equals the rank of the fundamental group of\nthe subgraph of the cosets graph of $H$, which consists of the paths starting\nat $1$ that are of length $\\leq i$. When $H$ is supnormal, i.e. contains a\nnon-trivial normal subgroup of $F$, we show that its rank-growth is equivalent\nto the cogrowth of $H$. A special case of this is the known result that a\nsupnormal subgroup of $F$ is of finite index if and only if it is finitely\ngenerated. In particular, when $H$ is normal then the growth of the group\n$G=F/H$ is equivalent to the rank-growth of $H$. A Schreier transversal forms a\nspanning tree of the cosets graph of $H$, and thus its topological structure is\nof a contractible spanning subcomplex of a simplicial complex. The\n$d$-dimensional simplicial complexes that contain contractible spanning\nsubcomplexes have the homotopy type of a bouquet of $r$ $d$-spheres. When these\ncomplexes are also $n$-regular then $r$ can be computed by generalizing the\nrank formula (which applies to Schreier transversals) to higher dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 1994 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The asymptotic behavior of this\nquotient is similar to the asymptotic behavior of the quotient of the\ncardinality of the boundary of the subgraph by the cardinality of the subgraph.\nUsing F&#248;lner's criterion for amenability one gets that $\\Xi (G^{\\alpha})$\nvanishes for infinite groups if and only if they are amenable. When $G$ is\nfinite then $\\Xi (G^{\\alpha})=1/|G|$, where $|G|$'> is the cardinality of $G$,\nand when $G$ is non-amenable then $1-n\\leq\\Xi (G^{\\alpha})\\le 0$, with $\\Xi\n(G^{\\alpha})=1-n$ if and only if $G$ is free of rank $n$.
